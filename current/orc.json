Considering the historical contexts of contact between Africa, Europe, and the Americas, we examine cultural, economic, and philosophic aspects of Africa. We will examine how ideas of what it means to be African culturally, racially, and politically are continually produced and contested. The moment of independence of many African nation-states from European colonial rule in the mid 20th century operates as a centering point from which we will examine economics, race, politics, and artistic expressions. We will consider ideas of “tradition” and “modernity,” representations of Africa, more recent processes of commodification, as well as various cultural and political responses to them.",

    "description": "This interdisciplinary course explores the historical legacy of public rituals of extreme violence against African American peoples as both sites of anti-black state and non-state sanctioned disciplinary projects as well as time-spaces of radical resistance. From the slave trade to life and labor under conditions of slavery to post-reconstruction segregation to lynching to police violence, American history can be read through the changing nature of the public torture of Black peoples. At the center of these forms of violence are the control of breath as life force and sign of freedom. This course examines the murder of Eric Garner in 2014 in a police-executed choke hold as a key event that both harkens back to a long history of lynchings and shootings and also to a history of how Black communities have organized around and resisted these forms of violence. Aesthetic representation has been intimately connected to anti-Black racial violence from photographs and postcards of lynchings in which white perpetrators pose alongside dead Black bodies to representations of Emmitt Till’s mutilated body at his funeral in an open casket to video of Rodney King’s beating to the continuing stream of video and images of extra-judicial killings of black citizens. Generations of artists in film, theater, painting/sculpture, dance, and across media have challenged and confronted this aesthetics of violence. This course explores theories of ritual and performance to understand how artists and communities come together as collectives to contextualize and re-present impossible terrors. Artists and political organizers use aesthetics and collective action to transform the horror of being subject to violence at any moment into rituals of potential social transformation. This course then teaches students theories of ritual and performance as ways that communities have historically engaged and confronted histories of anti-Black violences in order to conceive of new future possibilities in the face of disciplinary actions meant to contain and choke black people(s). In some manner, the course links African American experiences of violence and resistance to those of other African peoples around the world. This course is team taught and also draws upon the expertise of various faculty at Dartmouth. This course aims to link theories of Black life and performance to active practices of performance-making, interrogating the intersections between art and scholarship.",

    "description": "This course examines the Rastafari spiritual and political movement from its genesis in Jamaica to its transformation into a global phenomenon. Today’s perception of Rastafari is informed by popular images of marijuana smoking, reggae musicians and a laid-back lifestyle. Consequently, Rasta is often mistaken for practicing a countercultural phenomenon of no global significance, a poster child for the undesirable other, or merely a misguided rebel. Rastafari however, is significantly more profound. Rastafari has offered, cloaked in revolutionary black hermeneutics, some of the sharpest critiques against European imperialism and exploitation. Despite the presence of burgeoning scholarship, Rasta’s global significance remains hidden in the fissures of most historical discourses and behind the haze of marijuana smoke created by popular understandings of the movement. This course employs monographs, scholarly articles, documentary films and primary sources and music to and explore Rastafarian ideologies that among other things, promoted decolonization while decrying racism and imperialism. It is open to students seeking to broaden their knowledge of religions and socio-political movements in the African diaspora.",

As the first Africans in the New World to achieve this feat, Maroon warriors directly and indirectly influenced abolitionist and revolutionary movements throughout the Americas—including, of course, revolts in Haiti and the United States. These warriors continued to inspire the revolutionary actions of other oppressed and/or enslaved individuals for generations, and indeed, a revolutionary ethos pervades Jamaican culture and artistic production from the colonial period to the present moment.

    "description": "French national narrative, as shown in media and taught in the schools, marginalizes the ways in which the slave trade, slavery and the colonial empire have shaped the social, political, economic and cultural making of France. This narrative is one that continues to ignore the African presence, now on French soil for centuries, as does it consider its Black and Muslim citizens as second-class. Moreover, to French society, racism became an opinion rather than an ideology and the colonial past a forgotten chapter with the collapse of the French colonial empire in 1962 at the end of the war in Algeria. Yet, reports and studies from governmental and non-governmental antiracism associations document and denounce the existence of racial discrimination and racism in everyday life, which echo past representations and practices. Indeed, social and cultural movements continue to question silences on the colonial past and how it facilitates anti-Black racism. In this course, we will explore how the coloniality of republican power – the ways in which processes of racialization continue to operate and to create spaces of greater vulnerability – are rooted in a historical context of slavery that continues to operate after 1962 as well as the counter-narratives and cartographies that have emerged in response.",

This course proceeds from the idea that carceral geographies such as prison towns, detention centers, police departments, welfare agencies, and surveillance apparatuses are spatial fixes for social, economic, and political crises. We will engage scholarship from critical prison studies, geography, gender and sexuality studies, and critical ethnic studies to understand the different dimensions and question that emerge from thinking about space, race, gender, sexuality, land, labor, and state capacity together. Students will have an opportunity to build their understanding of the historical and contemporary organization of people, places, ideas and infrastructure that makes up US carceral geographies. Student will also have a chance to familiarize themselves with the history of resistance to penal democracy. This course requires dedicated and rigorous reading.

The Black Arts Movement had far-reaching implications for the way artists and writers think about race, history, authorship, and the relationship between artistic production and political liberation. We'll explore these issues in work by Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and others who forged the traditionally-defined Black Arts Movement in Harlem. We'll also trace the movement's flowering around country, where local political struggles and artistic traditions in Chicago, Newark, Los Angeles, and Detroit shaped distinctive regional variations of the Black Arts Movement.

Drawing on primary sources, film, and literature, we will examine the transnational dialogue among US African Americans, Afro-Latinos, and Afro-Caribbeans from the 19th century to the present. We will also consider why efforts to mobilize Afro-descendants across the Americas have often been undermined by mutual misunderstandings, conflicting agendas, and differing conceptions of \"race\" and \"nation.\"",

Yet the meaning of violence is seldom analyzed. Using an ethnographic lens, this course explores violence as both an embodied experience and a culturally and politically mediated event. We examine spectacular and everyday violence forms of violence in terms of manifestations of power, structures of inequality, perceptions of difference, and politics of representation. Ethnographic studies are drawn from, among others, Mozambique, Haiti, and Harlem. An introduction to the cultural anthropology of violence, this course raises key questions about violence in a globalized world and explores how to study it anthropologically.

From the recent Hollywood blockbuster 12 Years a Slave (2013) to the streets of Ferguson and Baltimore, the legacies of slavery and racial violence continue to cast their shadow over horizons of emancipationist history even as America commemorates the sesquicentennial of the U.S. Civil War. In this course we will revisit the literatures of slavery and antislavery in the Atlantic world from the eighteenth century to the present. Our novels and stories imagine episodes of slavery, slave rebellion, and fugitive flights to freedom across two centuries: from early transatlantic crossings of slaves and servants to the New World; to Tacky’s Revolt and its place in what Vincent Brown has recently called the “Coromantee Archipelago” in eighteenth century slave rebellion; to the spectacular soundings of the Haiti Revolution in the Age of Revolutions; to the messianic prophecies of Nat Turner in the early nineteenth century; to slave rebellions at sea; and finally to fugitive slave fictions in the abolitionist decade leading up to the Civil War.",

Examining various institutionally structured encounters between Europeans and non-Western peoples we unpack assumptions about the naturalness of power.

How have forms of political representation changed over the past century? How does state policy affect the ability of groups to mobilize and press for demands?

Was it the War on Drugs, or the long term effects of housing discrimination?\nThis course is designed to explore and explain these questions by unpacking the roles of surveillance, criminalization, policing and incarceration to historical and contemporary US state formation and global capitalism. Proceeding from the idea that carceral geographies such as prison towns, policing, and surveillance are spatial fixes for social, economic, and political crises, we will engage scholarship from a variety of fields including: critical prison studies, geography, cultural studies, gender and sexuality studies, and critical ethnic studies. Students will have an opportunity to understand the historical and contemporary organization of people, places, ideas, and infrastructure that makes up US carceral geographies of the United States.

    "description": "In light of recent protest movements that target issues of race and gender, the prescient words of numerous artists continue to be evoked and volleyed about in contemporary media outlets. Yet the contexts of many of these utterances are largely ignored. Delving into some of these contexts and engaging many of these artists’ larger oeuvre, this course is a multidisciplinary investigation of major protest poets of the twentieth century. It explores the ways in which poets living in the United States, and particularly members of historically marginalized communities, not only pushed back at the powers-that-be, but continuously saw and articulated themselves as simultaneously a part of and a part from larger “American” society. The course wrestles with the well-known and often contentious topics: race, class, and gender. Starting with turn-of-the-century writers like Claude McKay—whose words have become synonymous with outspoken critiques of World War I and the “Red Scare”—and ending with contemporary writers like Balakian and Chin, the course moves chronologically. Some of the writers it examines include, Peter Balakian, Amiri Baraka, Staceyann Chin, Lucille Clifton, Mayda Del Valle, Karen Garrabrant, Allen Ginsberg, Zbignew Herbert, Robert Lowell, Juan Felipe Herrera, Langston Hughes, Etheridge Knight, Denise Levertov, Haki Madhubuti, Jill McDonough, Claude McKay, Alice Notley, Emmy Perez, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Sonia Sanchez, and Dorothy Tse.",

    "description": "In 1738, a hundred years before legal emancipation came to England’s New World slave colonies, Jamaica’s Maroons forced the colonial power to sign a treaty granting sovereignty to Maroon communities across the Caribbean island. As the first Africans in the New World to achieve this feat, Maroon warriors directly and indirectly influenced abolitionist and revolutionary movements throughout the Americas—including, of course, revolts in Haiti and the United States. These warriors continued to inspire the revolutionary actions of other oppressed and/or enslaved individuals for generations, and indeed, a revolutionary ethos pervades Jamaican culture and artistic production from the colonial period to the present moment. This course traces the impact of “Jamaican” revolutionary figures on other revolutionary figures and events worldwide. Moving chronologically, from colonialism to the present day, the course examines influences such as African/Jamaican Maroon leaders direct impact on other revolutions throughout the Americas; Mary Seacole’s exchanges with and impact on Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War; Marcus Garvey’s impact on the Harlem Renaissance and the Rastafari religion; Claude McKay’s revolutionary impact on vernacular poetics and on the “Red Scare;” Louise Bennett’s mid-twentieth century revolutionary, feminist, vernacular poetics and her impact on female performers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa; Bob Marley and Damian Marley’s impact on politics and revolutionary movements in Liberia and Ghana; and finally, the impact of Staceyann Chin’s outspoken poetics on LGBTQ rights in the Caribbean and in other marginalized African diasporic communities.

The Renaissance city was reinvented as a utopia, featuring straight processional avenues, a rigid street plan, and monumental sculptures inserted into public squares like props on a stage. We will consider a wide range of case studies, from fictional cities imagined in the pages of sketchbooks to new cities and towns that were built from the ground up. Throughout, we will question how architects exploited the basic infrastructure of daily life – roads, gates, walls, squares, and even sewage systems – to perfect their environments. How were those principles used to promote civic virtue and good governance or to reinforce social hierarchies and absolutist rule?

The fifteenth century sees the rise of secular art, the concept of objective realism, the development of panel painting, the commercialization of prints, and the beginnings of independent portraiture. My goal is to give you the knowledge and skills that will enable you to understand and appreciate the nuances and complexity in fifteenth-century artworks wherever you encounter them.

The Reformation brought into question the assumptions by which most Europeans had lived—that the Church’s teachings, personal good actions, and Christ’s sacrifice could insure their salvation. Using the printing press and artworks, both sides presented their positions in propagandistic language that could be both bombastic and subtle.

Focusing primarily on writers and texts from France, Germany and Italy, we will consider the social and cultural roles of the artist and art works as they were formulated, investigated and reinterpreted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The classical revival and the beginnings of “modern” art history, the growth of the periodical press and the explosion of art (and literary) criticism, the growing public sphere for art, the biographical tendency in historical writing, and Romantic fantasies of the artist all worked to create a rich body of literary or quasi-literary writings on art and artists at this time.\n Many of the texts we will read were translated into other languages soon after their initial appearance, testifying to the international readership and scope of these writers and their works. The figure of the artist as developed in the 18th and 19th centuries only became more prominent in our cultural consciousness in the 20th century as Romanticism’s ideas of genius and the vanguard (often mad) artist and the separate sphere of the visual arts became entrenched in discourses of modernism. Exploring writings on art at this critical juncture in the beginnings of modernism can shed light on our continuing notions of what art is and has been, and on how art and artists have been described, understood, and fantasized about for centuries.",

The course consists largely of four themes: the Silk Road and the Arts, the Pottery Stories, the Jesuits and the Arts, and Asian Arts in Europe. The class starts with the Silk Road, the world’s first great superhighway that from ancient times linked East Asia to the Mediterranean World across Central Asia, and examines how ideas, art, and religions traveled and were transformed through their journey. The second theme, the Porcelain stories, conveys how aesthetics, technology, designs and motifs were transmitted from East to West and vice versa. We will ask questions, such as: Why was porcelain so desirable? Where did porcelain rank in the hierarchy of art forms and materials in Asia and Europe? How much did a piece of porcelain cost at any moment in time? Why did Japan and Korea have “the Pottery War” and what was the significance of that war in East Asia (and Europe)? The third theme, the Jesuits and the Arts, looks at the hybrid blend of two or more traditions and the artistic productions that arose from those blends. We also will examine together the paintings of Asian and European artists, the paintings of European artists on Asian themes with a traditional Asian medium, and the work of Asian painters’ on European subject matter with a European medium. The last theme, Asian art in Europe, scrutinizes the Western reception of Asian subjects, motifs, designs, and aesthetic values, and their appropriation for artistic productions. European interpretation (or imitation) of Chinese arts, so called Chinoiseries, and the Japanese influence on European art, known as Japonism, will be closely examined. Through lectures, readings, and films, we will explore the historical and artistic links between East and West and some selected art associated with those routes.

They will consider how character and class are constructed through the portrait; how the claims of settler nationalism are naturalized through landscape; how anxieties about racial emancipation, immigration, and gender advancement are managed through images of the “people;” how war both consolidated and radically challenged prevailing conceptions of American identity; and how minoritized populations challenged the dominant construction of “America” throughout this period. There are no pre-requisites for this course. It has been designed as an introduction to the field of American art history as well as to the discipline of Art History more generally. First year students and non-majors are welcome.",

In this course we will examine how painting, sculpture, photography, public murals, and monuments contributed to the political and economic rise and cultural dominance of the United States in the 20th century. Find out: how artists from the US and Mexico contributed to the search for the “Americanness” of American art; how African-Americans, Native Americans, Latino/as, women, and queer Americans have contributed to and challenged the image of America they created; how artists participated in the Cold War; and in turn, how the Cultural Cold War spawned a radical counter-culture and a new “culture war” over identity in the 1990s. In this course, students will develop a basic understanding of the development of U.S. American art—the major figures, movements, and themes—over the course of the 20th century; learn how to visually analyze and write about works of art executed in different media and for different viewing contexts; learn how to locate a specific artist’s handling of a subject, theme, or motif within a particular socio-political context and be able to compare and contrast different artistic expressions of a subject, theme, or motif across time, develop a more nuanced understanding of social movements in the 20th century United States, develop a greater appreciation for the contributions of minoritized groups to American art, culture, and history; question received notions of “American” culture and identity; and engage in productive discussion about the strategic value, situated meaning, and intersectionality of nation, class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and identity.

We will approach this topic through case studies of the major figures and movements in the cosmopolitan centers of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and the U. S. We will treat Latin America as a geopolitical construct rather than an essential unity. Throughout the course we will be attentive to the distinctive character of the different national histories, populations, and cultural traditions that have shaped artistic production in this region while still acknowledging points of convergence, influence, and shared conviction among them. We will examine how national identity, racial formation, class difference, gender inequality, political struggle, and state violence have been addressed by artists from the region and in diaspora. Students will learn about the major figures, movements, and genres of Latin and Latin@ American art: such as, modernismo, muralism, social realism, surrealism, geometric abstraction, kinetecism, and neo-concretismo, Latin American pop and conceptual art, installation, performance, and exhibition practices. They will develop an appreciation for the racialized modernisms of many Latin American countries and an ability to compare and contrast different iterations of hybridity from Mexican Indigenismo, to afro-Cubanismo, to Brazilian Anthropophagism (cannibalism), among others. They will develop an appreciation for how artists from Latin America have intervened in international avant-garde discourses by developing “ex-centric” strategies or ethics of avant-gardism. And they will explore the critical and reciprocal relationship between Latin American modernisms and state modernization and authoritarianism. This course has no pre-requisites and is accessible to both majors and non-majors. Students need no prior knowledge about Art History or Latin American art and history.",

    "description": "Since the Mexican Revolution (1910-17), artists, intellectuals, and state-actors have endeavored to define and re-define Mexican national identity, or what is known as Mexicanidad. From the 1920s and 30s, when an emphasis was placed on Mexico’s rural and indigenous populations to the 1940s and 50s, when greater attention was given to Mexican modernization, through the years after 1968, when artists and intellectuals endeavored to reveal the repressive nature of Mexicanidad and its role in propagandizing an authoritarian state and ruling party. In this course we will place artists like José Clemente Orozco and Frida Kahlo within a broader visual cultural context that includes not only mural art and painting, but also sculpture, architecture, printmaking, photography, installation, film, and performance. We will cover art produced in Mexico from the turn of the 20th century through the “boom” years of the 1990s, with a focus on issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality throughout. Students will learn about the history of Mexican art, enhance skills in the visual analysis of modern and contemporary art, refine their ability to conduct original research and write effectively, and develop an understanding of how visual culture participates in the construction of national identity as well as how art can critique and queer that construction. This course has no pre-requisites and requires no prior knowledge of Art History or Mexican art and history.",

From posters of United Farm Worker boycotts and broadsides of the Young Lords to contemporary prints that narrate stories of migration and belonging, we will delve into graphic media and consider notions of authorship (collective/individual), activism, display, dissemination, consumption, collecting, and technology. Students will learn to think critically and empathetically about how these collective modes of art-making foreground the politics of representation: what we see, how we see, who gets to control our image, and how can printed multiples challenge those narratives.

    "description": "European culture was transformed during the period 1750-1850. The absolutist monarchy established by Louis XIV would end with the traumatic rupture of the French Revolution. Napoleon redrew the map of Europe. The aristocracies that had ruled the West for a millennium, withered as the bourgeoisie and working classes struggled for control. The optimism of the Enlightenment slowly soured into the brooding inwardness of Romantic melancholia. The rise of mass industrial production and consumption would be accompanied by waves of technological and social change that irrevocably altered daily life. European powers pursued global dominance through colonial expansion with renewed vigor and brutality. This course examines these epochal changes through the lends of European cultural production, covering key artistic movements such as the Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, and Realism. We will closely analyze major works of art and visual culture alongside primary, historical texts of the period. These will be supplemented with recent scholarship that will help situate the works under investigation within the rich and complex social and intellectual milieu in which they were produced.",

It includes recent works by artists from nations as diverse as Algeria, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Turkey and the UAE. One of the main objectives of the course is to look at art practices that attempt to deepen our understanding of the varied cultures, ethnicities and societies that are found in this part of the world. The geographic focus of the course–mostly the Muslim nations of the Arabian peninsula and North Africa–is not meant to perpetuate the assumptions about this region as a monolithic geopolitical entity, nor to blindly label its production according to existing ethnic, religious or national categories. Against media stereotypes of the region, the artists studied in this course have made work that function as a critical platform for rethinking traditional identity formations and extending the space of cultural encounter across borders (territorial, political, linguistic). In many cases these artists may not be living and working in their country of birth but their ethnicity, religion or citizenship continues to inform both their own sense of identity and the terms of their art practice. Some of the topics to be discussed include: artistic responses to the Arab-Israeli conflict, representations of everyday life in times of war, the movement and obstruction of people, goods and information across borders, the rise of new art markets in the Middle East, the politics of gender and sexuality in the Arab world, and the of use archival documents to rethink the meaning of evidence, truth and testimony.",

We will examine case studies of satirical production, from the 18th century through the late 20th century, from the darkly comic prints of Hogarth and Daumier, to the overtly humorous and/or subversive gestures of Duchamp and Dada, Warhol and Pop Art, to the satire of gender roles and modern capitalism in Postmodernism. We will pay particular attention to the role of satire in modern art as it employed irony, parody, ridicule and exaggeration to attack social mores, political figures and the art world status quo. We will also explore the use of satire in film and TV, from the darkly comic (Charlie Chaplin) to the ridiculous (Stephen Colbert).

Declared “divine,” during his lifetime, he has been celebrated as the non plus ultra of artistic genius, or vilified as the very epitome of artistic excess ever since. Enthusiasts and detractors alike have viewed Michelangelo as the model of the self-conscious artist. This course will trace ‘il divino’s’ role in the formation of the cult of the modern artist through examining artworks and texts ranging from the artist’s lifetime and afterlife in art, literature, and film. Beginning with the construction of Michelangelo’s persona by early biographers, we will consider why he came to embody the tension between the demands of tradition and innovation like no other artist. Each week we will closely investigate artworks in dialogue with primary sources in English translation. Secondary texts selected from the superb scholarly literature on Michelangelo and his afterlife will be used to supplement primary materials.

Drawing on a range of critical texts and artistic practices, we will consider how fundamental aesthetic categories such as materiality and form are transformed through the radical shift from a work-oriented to a medium-oriented conception of art and reality. In broader terms, this module explores the rapidly mutable audio-visual environments/interfaces of the digital age and their impact on social relations and cultural production. We will also examine the tensions between intimacy and distance, distraction and attention, and passivity and participation that characterize image consumption within the routines of contemporary technological culture. Finally, this module offers a historical and political framework for understanding contemporary art’s seeming disavowal of the digital and the expanding non-stop processes of twenty-first-century capitalism that underpin it. At the same time, we will assess some of emancipatory possibilities opened by the accessibility and affordability of digital cameras, editing software and mobile devices. As well as making use of the interpretive methods of art history, this module will introduce students to tools drawn from social semiotics, media studies, anthropology, visual culture, cybernetics and design philosophy.",

    "description": "Since the advent of industrial capitalism, humans have released 555 petagrams of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, increasing CO2 concentrations to a level not seen for at least 800,000 years. The long-term consequences of these atmospheric changes remain unknown, but there is already strong evidence that the Earth is rapidly moving into a less biologically diverse, less forested, much warmer, and probably wetter and stormier state. Research on climate change points to a particular irony: human actions have unprecedented impact on the environment, but this produces effects that are increasingly out of human control. Inside that conundrum lies another. Scientists have certain strategies to address urgent environmental challenges, but what of the arts and the humanities? What can practitioners in these fields, in dialogue with the sciences, offer in this moment of climatic disruption and political inaction? To what new modes of visualization does global warming give rise, and how do these aesthetic innovations allow us to live with and through environmental change? What ontological status can be assigned to various biological, geological, and meteorological ‘actors’ if human agency is no longer privileged?\nIn taking up these questions, this course recognizes that the manifold effects of climate change demand new structures of cross-disciplinary thinking and critical engagement. Accordingly, it draws on concepts and methods drawn from art history and critical theory as well as science and anthropology. As we will see, the field of contemporary art does not simply project forward to predicted catastrophic future scenarios. Rather, it foregrounds the unique capacities of humans to imagine scenarios or worlds that have not yet come into existence.  What, in essence, can art help us imagine that science alone cannot? Through this line of enquiry, this course asks what it means to think through the possibilities and limits of our planet beyond a pessimistic orientation towards foreclosed futures.",

The seminar commences with a traditional typological survey of domes, progresses to explore the theoretical foundations that informed their construction, and concludes by examining the social, cultural, and religious factors favoring (or discouraging) their development and proliferation. We will focus especially, but not uniquely, on ancient and medieval domes. Historically, domes have covered a range of buildings: from kilns to tombs, from bell-towers to latrines; however, they most famously crowned places of worship, burial or power. We will ponder: What is a dome? Which qualities define their identities? How and why has the knowledge of dome construction been transferred across time and cultures? What are important methodological considerations to consider as we approach the study of domes?",

The topic is framed around two related questions: How does the special status of art, as a privileged sphere of creative expression, grant it different treatment under the law? What are some of the exemptions, protections, or obligations that are accorded to art that are not extended to other forms of personal property? The first part of the course will focus on case studies in which legal questions are entangled with ethical and political concerns: illicit international trade in looted art, repatriation claims, high-profile forgeries, and new guidelines for authentication. The second half looks at the legal framework that governs artists’ rights (including resale royalties, copyright, and freedom of expression) as well as the rules that structure transactions in the primary (e.g. artist-dealer contracts and handshake agreements) and secondary art markets. We will also analyze problems related to the representation of artists’ estates, the acquisition and de-accessioning of artworks by museums, and the tax codes associated with charitable contributions of works of art. Finally, the class considers how artists strategically make use of the unique affordances of the law and test what it is that artworks can do outside the circumscribed domain of the art world.",

We will tour various historical genres: erotic how-to, epic, mystical poetry, drama. The ideal bond in many of these texts unites a human subject with a divine lover.",

Since then, these countries have wrestled with issues of governance and development, but colonial rule casts a long shadow over their efforts. This course introduces students to the complex politico-economic landscape of the subcontinent by examining how the idea of development changes in modern South Asian history. How are developmental efforts embedded in contexts of politics, society, and culture? How do political systems affect decisions? This course considers these questions by examining themes such as the colonial state's construction of railway and irrigation networks; Gandhi's critique of industrialization; Nehru's vision of an industrial economy; the challenges posed by Partition and militarization of Pakistan; the Green Revolution; and the onset of economic deregulation.",

This culminated in Partition and the emergence of the nations of India and Pakistan. Independence was marred, however, by the bloodshed accompanying the mass movements of Muslims into Pakistan and Hindus into India. What were the factors leading to this juxtaposition of triumphal Independence with shameful Partition?  What were the implications of Partition for ordinary people?  How have memories of Partition continued to affect powerfully politics and culture in the subcontinent? This seminar investigates such questions using a wide variety of materials including films, memoir, fiction, and scholarly works.  This course follows recent scholarship in focusing on the long-term implications of Partition for the subcontinent.  Hence, while we certainly will investigate the events leading up to Partition, our emphasis will be on understanding the effects of Partition on the lives of ordinary people during and after.",

The ways Chinese people deal with their ethnic minority regions, differentiate the northerners and the southerners, view their own culture and cultural others and imagine their regional and global roles can all be related to the spatial conceptions with regard to the frontier in pre-modern China. This course will trace the development of these conceptions through a variety of philosophical, cosmological, religious, historical, geographical, and literary texts and images. Classical Chinese texts however are not categorized by discipline but represent a body of interdisciplinary knowledge that reflects the culture’s thoughts and values. The course will deal with the materials in a way that relive their a-disciplinary nature while maintaining a critical perspective on them.

Thus the poetry-calligraphy-painting “Three Perfections” represents certain significant aspects of the Chinese culture. Since none of the “Three Perfections” is possible beyond the intellectual context of Chinese philosophy, and also, since the traditional Chinese painting has to be written (in the way of Chinese calligraphy) rather than painted, the Chinese painting/calligraphy, poetry, and philosophy are indeed the key for understanding the Chinese culture. By introducing the basics of traditional Chinese painting/calligraphy, classical Chinese poetry, Chinese cosmology, philosophy and religions, this course is the gateway to the Chinese manuscript culture that defines the written tradition of the Chinese culture. The first-hand experience of basic brush-and-ink techniques of traditional Chinese shuhua (calligraphy and painting) provides the student with visual and enjoyable illustrations of the relationship between traditional Chinese art and cosmology.

In South Korea, most people classify themselves as Buddhist or Christian; in Japan, the majority consider themselves non-religious, yet visit Buddhist temples and hold Buddhist funerals; in North Korea, roughly 10,000 Buddhists remain in spite of religious persecution by the state. Clerical marriage is widely accepted in Buddhist sects throughout Japan, whereas the practice has been the subject of heated debate in South Korea since the 1950s.

The course consists largely of four themes: the Silk Road and the Arts, the Pottery Stories, the Jesuits and the Arts, and Asian Arts in Europe. The class starts with the Silk Road, the world’s first great superhighway that from ancient times linked East Asia to the Mediterranean World across Central Asia, and examines how ideas, art, and religions traveled and were transformed through their journey. The second theme, the Porcelain stories, conveys how aesthetics, technology, designs and motifs were transmitted from East to West and vice versa. We will ask questions, such as: Why was porcelain so desirable? Where did porcelain rank in the hierarchy of art forms and materials in Asia and Europe? How much did a piece of porcelain cost at any moment in time? Why did Japan and Korea have “the Pottery War” and what was the significance of that war in East Asia (and Europe)? The third theme, the Jesuits and the Arts, looks at the hybrid blend of two or more traditions and the artistic productions that arose from those blends. We also will examine together the paintings of Asian and European artists, the paintings of European artists on Asian themes with a traditional Asian medium, and the work of Asian painters’ on European subject matter with a European medium. The last theme, Asian art in Europe, scrutinizes the Western reception of Asian subjects, motifs, designs, and aesthetic values, and their appropriation for artistic productions. European interpretation (or imitation) of Chinese arts, so called Chinoiseries, and the Japanese influence on European art, known as Japonism, will be closely examined. Through lectures, readings, and films, we will explore the historical and artistic links between East and West and some selected art associated with those routes. This course requires no previous experience, but is intended for those who like interdisciplinary approaches to art and culture. No previous coursework is required.",

This will require accounting for differences in religious belief, notions of psychology, and literary and artistic form.  Is the process of mourning universal? Are the responses to atrocity?  Is comparing the Japanese and Jewish cases ethically suspect? How does a nation that has victimized mourn its own victimization?",

To qualify for the Honors Program the applicant must have a GPA of 3.0 overall and GPA of 3.4 in the major. Admission to the program is contingent upon acceptance of the applicant’s thesis proposal. Students should develop a thesis proposal in consultation with a prospective advisor. The primary advisor for an honors thesis must be an ACSL affiliated faculty member. Secondary advisors drawn from ASCL or other departments and programs are encouraged when the student’s project warrants additional expertise. Proposal guidelines can be found on the ASCL website.\n            As part of the Honors curriculum, ASCL 90 and 91 carry high expectations regarding student performance with regard to writing, deadlines, accountability, and critical reflection. The thesis advisor will assess the student’s progress at the end of the first term of the Honors course sequence. If insufficient progress has been made on the thesis, students will be dropped from the program and given a grade for the work completed in the first term. The grade can count toward the ASCL major but not as a substitute for the ASCL Culminating Experience. A public presentation of the honors thesis at the end of the second term is a requirement of the Honors program. Completion of both ASCL 90 and 91 replace the ASCL culminating experience. ASCL 91 is an addition to ASCL’s ten-course major.\n            Students wishing to pursue a fall/winter thesis should submit their proposal to the Steering Committee no later than the fifth week of their junior-year spring term. Proposals for winter/spring theses should be submitted no later than the fifth week of the applicants senior-year fall term. Admission to the Honors Program is by vote of ASCL Steering Committee.\n             Students are awarded one course credit for successful completion of this course upon completion of ASCL-091. Students register for ASCL-090 and receive a grade of “ON” (ongoing) at the end of the term. Students then register for ASCL-091 the subsequent term to complete the coursework.

BIOL 57 focuses on coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean. Students are challenged to know, understand and appreciate the diversity of form and function in organisms, and the interactions that generate the often-spectacular patterns they see in the field. Habitats in Costa Rica include lowland rain forest, cloud forest, dry forest, montane forest, alpine paramo, streams and wetlands. The schedule is full, including fieldwork, laboratories, lectures and discussions, with emphasis on original research, mostly in small groups of 2-3. Faculty and advanced graduate TAs share field accommodations with students, and are in continuous contact as mentors, day and evening, throughout the program. Students master field and analytical methods (including hypothesis testing, statistical and software skills) for observational and experimental research. We pursue a great variety of research topics, including plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions, processes driving coral reef structure (and coral reef decline), determinants of species distributions, animal behavior, and conservation ecology. Students practice the classic scientific approach: making observations, asking testable questions, generating hypotheses, developing experimental protocols, collecting data, making statistical inferences, writing scientific papers, and presenting seminars. Research papers are published in an annual book. Accommodations are at field stations in Costa Rica, and at a marine laboratory in the Caribbean.  Acceptance into Program is required.  In addition, BIOL 15 & BIOL 29 are recommended.",

In fact, the very question of “what is a gene?” is even being reconsidered, as the fundamental unit of genomic organization appears not to be the classical DNA-based “gene” but instead is the RNA-based transcript.  In this course we will explore these issues and more through lectures, literature discussions, student-led presentations, and student writing assignments.",

But the notion of love as a conquering force also hints at its ability to overwhelm, subdue, and destroy. The idea of love, broadly conceived, is embedded in the literature, philosophy, scientific thought, religion, and art and archaeology of the Romans. We will explore love in its various forms – devotion, lust, physical sexuality, friendship, and familial bonds – by looking at the central authors and genres of the Latin literary tradition (in English translation). Our discussion of these core texts will be further enriched by an examination of additional ancient sources, including Greek and Roman visual art, monuments and architecture, coins, and inscriptions.",

    "description": "Digitization of vast numbers of texts and rapid advances in computational methods are enabling new forms of criticism in all areas of literary study. Classics was an early adopter of digital technologies, and computation is now pervasive throughout the field, as illustrated by flagship projects such as the Perseus Digital Library. Beyond the familiar examples of digitized texts and simple word searches, scholars and students also benefit from an ever-growing array of sophisticated quantitative tools, and from increasing engagement with diverse technical disciplines – natural language processing, data science, even bioinformatics. Through a survey of recent research at the intersection of Latin literature and the digital humanities, this course will introduce you to the state of the art in quantitative literary criticism. To ground our methodological investigations, we will explore a diverse selection of Latin poetry, including epic (Vergil, Lucan, and Catullus), elegy (Catullus), and comedy (Plautus), and sample some less famous later authors, such as Paul the Deacon and Vitalis of Blois, who were influenced by classical antecedents. At each turn, we will examine the interplay between traditional (close reading, philology, theory) and data-driven analyses of Latin literature and consider how quantitative methods can support humanistic inquiry. Along the way, you will gain hands-on experience with powerful computational tools and be introduced to now ubiquitous critical approaches, such as intertextuality and reception studies. Assigned readings will be in English translation using bilingual Latin-English editions; in addition to reading all of the English, students with Latin will be responsible for understanding and translating “micro samples” of the original texts.

Corinth’s territory was, compared to that of Sparta, minuscule, but it became a powerful and wealthy community through the foundation of numerous colonies and commerce. Sparta was famed for its army, Corinth for its navy. Spartans were known for the simplicity of their lifestyle and the architectural simplicity of their city, whereas Corinthians overtly enjoyed luxuries and erected some of the Greeks’ earliest large-scale stone temples.

Sparta conquered much of the southern Peloponnese and became a militarized society with an economy based almost entirely on agriculture. Corinth’s territory was, compared to that of Sparta, minuscule, but it became a powerful and wealthy community through the foundation of numerous colonies and commerce. Sparta was famed for its army, Corinth for its navy. Spartans were known for the simplicity of their lifestyle and the architectural simplicity of their city, whereas Corinthians overtly enjoyed luxuries and erected some of the Greeks’ earliest large-scale stone temples. By comparing and contrasting Sparta and Corinth, we can develop a good sense of the Greek world during the Archaic period.",

While we treat them as distinct phenomena, the overlap between the two is immense, structurally, neurologically, and culturally. Such connections have long been recognized, but recent research from diverse fields like linguistics, (ethno)musicology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience continues to reveal just how intertwined the two faculties are. Drawing on this body of research and our respective specialties, we explore the language-music connection from the basic ingredients (pitch, timbre, rhythm, syntax), to cultural expression, to evolution and origins. Running through the course is a hands-on case study of a West African xylophone tradition where language and music are so intimately related that they cannot be separated. Students will be taught by a master of the tradition, Mamadou Diabaté, to feel for themselves what it means to speak through an instrument.",

The Court found in favor of Dartmouth, which preserved the College as a private entity. Perhaps more importantly, it also laid the legal foundation for the modern economy, where corporate firms are to some extent free of state control. This course aims for a comprehensive understanding of the Dartmouth College Case and Daniel Webster by integrating the perspectives of American studies, history, political theory, and law.",

Commentators and scholars identify rampant capitalism, neoliberalism, globalization, and the untamed proliferation of new media as causes for the vulnerability democracies. While some consider the establishment of right-wing movements and politicians as expressions of a temporary populist phase or even the advent of a post-democratic age, others refer to white-supremacist attacks or the recurrence of KKK and neo-Nazi groups worldwide as harbingers of a new fascism. This course will discuss the central terms and concepts such as (illiberal) democracy, republicanism, neoliberalism, populism, or fascism, as well as (counter-) movements on both side such as the Tea Party, Alt-Right, the Brexit, as well as #MeToo, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter through a variety of artifacts, documentaries, movies, speeches, literary texts, news articles and theoretical debates.",

Or must a background desire to do the right thing be involved? Is all human motivation, by its nature, self-interested? Or is genuine altruism possible?

The authoritarian regimes installed in Brazil (1964-85), Uruguay (1973-85), Chile (1973-90) and Argentina (1976-83) caused deep ruptures in collective and individual lives and still resonate in the South American political, social and cultural landscapes. After the democratic systems were reestablished in the region, new facts about the abuse of power by the militaries were disclosed, and a heated debate took place in the public sphere about how to deal with the past. Feature films, documentaries, and fiction and non-fiction literature played an essential role in that debate by providing different strategies of healing scars, honoring victims and survivors, and preserving the memory of both the terror and the grassroots resistance. The experiences and memories of the so-called \"dirty war\" in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay generated not only several fictional renderings of state terrorism during the \"years of lead,\" but also a whole series of testimonios by those directly affected by it, such as the daughters, sons and spouses of desaparecidos who were assassinated by the machinery of state repression.\nThis class focuses on the legacies of dictatorships in South America and the politics and aesthetics of representation of state violence and political resistance.

Focusing primarily on writers and texts from France, Germany and Italy, we will consider the social and cultural roles of the artist and art works as they were formulated, investigated and reinterpreted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The classical revival and the beginnings of “modern” art history, the growth of the periodical press and the explosion of art (and literary) criticism, the growing public sphere for art, the biographical tendency in historical writing, and Romantic fantasies of the artist all worked to create a rich body of literary or quasi-literary writings on art and artists at this time.\n Many of the texts we will read were translated into other languages soon after their initial appearance, testifying to the international readership and scope of these writers and their works. The figure of the artist as developed in the 18th and 19th centuries only became more prominent in our cultural consciousness in the 20th century as Romanticism’s ideas of genius and the vanguard (often mad) artist and the separate sphere of the visual arts became entrenched in discourses of modernism. Exploring writings on art at this critical juncture in the beginnings of modernism can shed light on our continuing notions of what art is and has been, and on how art and artists have been described, understood, and fantasized about for centuries.",

In this course, we will examine noir in relation to its many contexts: the hard-boiled fiction of Chandler and Hammett; the experience of dislocation and alienation that reflect the exile status of many central-European professionals who worked in the US film industry in the 1940s; and Hollywood blacklisting and censorship during the anti-Communist witch hunt. The course will also trace the pervasive presence of noir and its continuing appeal for artists and audiences throughout the world. Because of its artistic and political complexity, noir is a key term for the study of US postwar cultural history: noir narratives revolve around questions of racial and national identity, around the postwar crisis of masculinity, and the convergence of modernism and mass culture.",

In this course, we will investigate two national conspiracist traditions, the American and the Russian, and the parallel rise and stunning convergence of Russian and American conspiracism in our current political moment. In order to do so, we will inquire into the historical origins, the form, function, and effectiveness of conspiracist narratives in these two traditions in the 20th and 21st centuries. Ultimately we will approach conspiracy theories as ways of knowing, of penetrating and ordering complex and opaque realities. They are also powerful narrative weapons that imperil the shared truths on which cohesive societies are based. Our course texts include The Master and Margarita (Bulgakov), The Crucible (Miller), and Libra (DeLillo), Ivan the Terrible Part II (Eisenstein) The Manchurian Candidate (Frankenheimer) and The Matrix (The Wachkowskis) as well as literary and cultural studies of conspiracist narrative and ideation.",

Our discussions of the cultural imprint of Freudian thought will encompass a variety of themes, from gender and sexuality to Jewishness to the clinical techniques central to psychoanalytic practice.

It turns out that if you want the protocol to be fault-tolerant, i.e., the protocol works correctly even if one of the agents stops communicating, it is impossible to design a correct protocol (under certain reasonable assumptions about the system).\nIn the course, we will look at several fascinating coordination problems and solve them for several models of distributed computing: shared-memory versus message passing, synchronous versus asynchronous, fault-free versus fault-tolerant. We design algorithms, and prove lower bounds or even impossibility results.\nThere will be weekly homework and a final exam.\nPrerequisite: COSC 31 (Undergraduate Algorithms) or equivalent, and an interest in algorithms/theory.",

    "description": "How can we practice \"immersion journalism,\" as creative nonfiction is sometimes described, when writing about people and events of the past? In this creative nonfiction writing course, we'll immerse ourselves in the kind of research that will allow us to recreate moments and moods for which we couldn't be present. We'll become witnesses at a remove; and, through careful attention to our own roles in the construction of our stories, participant-observers, as well. We'll learn how to use archives; make creative use of documents and artifacts; engage with scholarly historical writing as a source for creative writing; and interrogate our assumptions about research and representation, all in the service of character-driven narratives as vivid, nuanced, and dramatic as writing based on contemporary fieldwork. This course is an attempt to raise the dead, to resurrect truths from dormant facts, to find stories of the present within the past. You'll write two short nonfiction stories, of a person and a place, based on secondary sources, and one long narrative based on original research. The texts we'll be reading, by Lauren Redniss, John D'Agata, Svetlana Alexievitch, Joe Sacco, Maggie Nelson, and Michael Lesy, among others, vary radically in form and medium, as may your own experimental nonfictions",

We will touch upon and reference those earlier works that have shaped the genre, such as We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and 1984 by George Orwell, but our primary focus will be on those fictions of the last forty years that ring prophetically and frighteningly true vis-à-vis events in our current world. We’ll be reading a wide variety of authors, which may include, Harlan Ellison, Philip K. Dick, Cormac McCarthy, J.G. Ballard, John Wyndham, Richard Matheson, and Anthony Burgess.

The United States has always figured heavily in the collective French imaginary ever since the American Revolution, for instance in the works of Tocqueville and Chateaubriand. American literature, however, gains particular prominence toward the mid-twentieth century with the transatlantic travels of Simone de Beauvoir, André Breton, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Philippe Sollers among authors, to the point that French writers began wondering how one can even be French in the first place. The course explores this crisis in national identity through a series of important poetic Franco-American friendships and collaborations: Edmond Jabès and Rosmarie Waldrop; Emmanuel Hocquard and Michael Palmer; Serge Pey and Allen Ginsberg; the Fondation Royaumont; the poetry collective double change; among others.",

A colossal influence on generations of writers, and readers, including T.S. Eliot, Derek Wolcott, Edna O’Brien and countless others, Ulysses is, among many other things, challenging, irreverent, thought-provoking, political, technically virtuosic, and above all wildly entertaining. Students will read some outside sources on Joyce but for the most part our primary text will be Joyce’s own words – wherever they lead us. Prepare to meet a fascinating and chaotic cast of characters featuring – Lilly, Kate and Julia Morkan, Gabriel Conroy, Stephan Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom, and many others. Assignments will include critical and creative responses to both “The Dead” and Ulysses, as well as a final essay.",

All toward the aim of collaboratively engaging in what we might call—in keeping with the Combahee River Collective, Sylvia Wynter, Fred Moten and others—theory in black, black thought, black study.",

We begin by discussing the properties of air and a few basic physical principles that control all atmospheric phenomena. These principles enable us to understand weather systems and associated fronts, clouds, winds, and precipitation, and to forecast weather using simple visual observations, satellite data and supercomputers. They are also the basis for the global circulation of air, energy and water, as well as the restlessly changing, diverse climate zones of our planet. Labs will provide hands-on experience observing the weather, building and using simple meteorological instruments, interpreting network data and satellite images, and forecasting the weather in real time. Additional topics may include air pollution, deliberate and inadvertent weather and climate modification, aviation and marine weather, and atmospheric chaos.",

A transition to a low carbon economy remains in distant future. Effective climate change mitigation requires urgent reductions of CO2 emissions and a portfolio of strategies for sequestering CO2. The intent of this course is to introduce geochemical principles that are being investigated to sequester CO2 already present in the atmosphere or that is released to the atmosphere by point sources such as coal-fired power plants. We will first focus on the scale of the problem and then study the science behind the proposed strategies that could reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. The course will draw from readings of primary literature in the diverse fields of mineralogy, petrology, geochemistry, and oceanography. These will be augmented by weekly student-led discussions with researchers in these fields. The course will conclude with a general discussion of issues of scaling and environmental impacts of the CO2 removal approaches and the way forward.

But there are a number of countries around the world whose economic organization is NOT mainly guided by markets; some of these economies remain partially controlled, or planned, where property and the means of production are formally government-owned and prices are centrally determined. This history of central planning has influenced the development of markets in much of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union; some economies have fully transitioned from planning to markets, while some lag significantly behind. In this class, students will study the history of the centrally-planned economic system and how it influenced economic development in Poland and we learn how Poland’s economy has transitioned to a market-oriented economy.",

While Chile has achieved economic growth and macroeconomic stability since the mid-1980s, Argentina has struggled to achieve the same outcome and has been beset by financial crises and currency collapses.

    "description": "Was there a British Enlightenment? In the age of the American and French Revolutions Britain seemed to hold steady. But in the literature of the period there are many social and literary struggles which took their tolls in the madness and suicide of writers such as Smart and Chatterton, the difficulties of attaining creative freedom, and the emergence of new literary forms such as the Gothic. This course will trace the fortunes of writers such as Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, Oliver Goldsmith, and Edmund Burke as they grapple with the anxieties of their time. We will also consider how women thinkers and novelists such as Charlotte Lennox and Mary Wollstonecraft forged new roles for themselves, and we may include studies of the novel of political paranoia such as Caleb Williams, written by Wollstonecraft's husband, William Godwin.",

At the same time, however, the prospect of revolutionary violence made the imagination a dangerous, and intensely debated faculty, as promising as it was potentially pathological, and as likely to produce a Gothic nightmare as a pastoral utopia. This course will examine the richly varied forms of literary and political experience that emerge out of this moment, and that continue to shape modern conceptions of creativity, sexuality, ecology and social transformation. Readings include works by William Blake, William Wordsworth, Percy and Mary Shelley, John Keats, and Thomas de Quincey.",

This seminar engages with Drake's poetry-pottery through critical and historical research, interpretive writing, and our own creative adventures in ceramic handicrafts. In addition to writing your own updated imitations of Dave Drake's poetry and attempting ceramic facsimiles of his earthenware, students will also spend time in the letterpress studio as a means of acquiring a deeper historical and aesthetic appreciation of Dave's life and work; it was while working as a typesetter for a regional newspaper that Dave acquired literacy. As a culminating assignment, students will contribute chapters to a scholarly book on Drake, which the instructor will edit.",

    "description": "F. O. Matthiessen coined the term “American Renaissance” in his groundbreaking book, The American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman (1941). At the outset of the nineteenth century American writers struggled with a sense of cultural inferiority and artistic belatedness. The “American Renaissance” demarcates a period as well as a cultural movement marked by intense literary activity between the 1830s and 1860s that aimed at the formation of a distinctively American literature. Matthiessen restricted the American Renaissance to the years between 1850 and 1855, an “extraordinarily concentrated moment of literary expression” (vii) that saw the publication of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, House of the Seven Gables, and The Blithedale Romance; Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Representative Men; Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick; Henry David Thoreau’s Walden; and Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. In the years since the publication of Matthiessen’s important work, teachers and scholars in American literature have extended the American Renaissance’s chronological provenance at least as far back as the anti-slavery debates in the 1830s and as far forward as the termination of the Civil War. In the past several decades, Matthiessen’s argument has been challenged for its exaggeration of the originality of his coterie of male authors, for the exclusion of women and African-American and popular authors from his account of the United States during a period of remarkable social and cultural transformation, and for its seemingly uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of American exceptionalism. In light of these criticisms, scholars have added Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass, Margaret Fuller, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Mark Twain (among others) to Matthiessen’s American Renaissance pantheon.",

As a result, the novels, poems, slave narratives, and short stories of nineteenth-century American literature abound with landscapes as social and psychological as they are physical.  Authors will include Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Frederick Douglass, Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Chesnutt, Mark Twain, and Willa Cather.  Dist: LIT; WCult: W.

How did these “divergent” systems of belief shape how people understood the world and their place in it?

How did Darwin and other scientists use literary techniques to convey their ideas to a widespread audience?

The orphans, adventurers, tricksters, and runaways in Victorian children’s books make friends with pirates, talk to animals, fly through the sky, and fall down rabbit holes. What made these stories so popular in the nineteenth century, and why do they continue to enchant readers? This course explores the genre of Victorian children’s literature in relation to such themes as Romantic innocence, nature and animal studies, climate change, sexuality and queerness, evolution, colonialism and race, disability studies, global economics, and play. Throughout the course, we’ll think about how stories for children are constructed and how writers and artists have adapted these Victorian texts for later audiences (e.g. through film, graphic novels, and fan fiction). The course will include both critical and creative assignments. Texts may include: Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Lewis Carroll), Treasure Island (Robert Louis Stevenson), The Jungle Books (Rudyard Kipling), Peter Pan (J. M.

    "description": "How does the shape of a narrative change the way we experience it? Beginning in 1836 with Charles Dickens’ first novel, Victorian audiences often read texts as weekly and monthly ‘parts’ rather than as literary ‘wholes’. In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming, and in 2013, the company began producing original content. Instead of waiting a week for the next television episode, audiences could binge watch entire seasons (or more). Both the serial and digital streaming have been called revolutionary, but what does this mean? This course pairs Victorian serial novels and Netflix original series in order to think critically about structure and form. How does the play between serial part and whole necessitate new temporalities, strategies of characterization and narration, and types of suspense? How does binge-watching disrupt or reshape narrative time and sequencing? How have both new forms altered cultural discourses on gender, social consciousness, crime, and politics? How do narratives intersect with other types of seriality, including evolution, reproduction and inheritance, election cycles, and the #MeToo movement? This course emphasizes close reading and watching as well as narrative theory and reception and moves between nineteenth-century novels and twenty-first century series.",

Key topics include: pre-comics visual storytelling and the conceptual problems with seeking such precedents; the explosion of the American comic strip during the Yellow Journalism period; the formats, forms, and genres of the early comic book industry; the rise of DC Comics, home to Superman; artist-run “shops” and the development of romance and horror comics; the 1950s Kefauver hearings and the introduction of the Comics Code; the “Silver Age,” the decline of DC and the rise of Marvel Comics; Underground Comix and Sixties counterculture; censorship and creative rights skirmishes of the 1980s and 90s; and the legitimation of comics as “graphic novels.” Along the way, we will read historical comics (in reprint anthologies) to explore the comics form: visual narration, the development and assignment of distinct styles to different genres, and the historical import of individual creators from Jerry Siegel and Will Eisner to Alison Bechdel and the Hernandez Brothers.",

Directed by Haitian-born filmmaker Raoul Peck, I Am Not Your Negro is a provocative documentary that envisions a book Baldwin never finished by providing insight into Baldwin's relationship with three men who were assassinated before their fortieth birthdays—Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\nIn this course we will interrogate questions of race, sexuality, violence, and migration. Our current political moment encourages the examination of these issues while Baldwin's life and work provides the ideal vantage point for their investigation. Using I Am Not Your Negro as our starting point, Baldwin's life and work will allow us the opportunity to explore transatlantic discourses on nationality, sexuality, race, gender, and religion. We will also explore the work of other writers including Richard Wright, Frantz Fanon, Audre Lorde, and Ta-Nehisi Coates.",

How might the “bad” and the “queer” name the refusal and failure to assimilate and align oneself with racial capital, settler colonial logics, and reproductive futurity? How might both terms require us to rethink what narratives of belonging look, feel, and sound like and in turn, become the grounds for alternative solidarities, affiliations, and intimacies across lines of minority difference? To answer these questions, we will engage with primarily contemporary Asian/American works of literature, poetry, film, performance, and art that alters, disrupts, and varies Asian/American narratives of migration, assimilation, and upward mobility. Through these works, we will address historical processes of Asian/American racial, gender, and sexual formation by way of the “bad” and the “queer,” as transformative political and aesthetic categories of inquiry that risk failing to fit in, being wrong, and not belonging.",

What language have they crafted, historically, to describe such an expansive, radical project? For the purposes of this course, we will linger with a wide range of cinematic and literary moments with the aim of framing a much larger conversation about the uses of black art-making as a means through which we might access a critical vocabulary for black feeling; might assert the breaking into the world of a black love that is both resistance and that which exceeds it, love as a sort of black operation, black love as an act of marronage. Towards that end, this course will employ the films of contemporary writer and director Barry Jenkins, and place them in direct conversation with a larger constellation of writings within the African American literary tradition. Through our collective investigation of these texts, we will work together toward the elaboration of an aesthetics of black love.",

Britain is also a literary hotbed, home to the Man Booker Prize for Fiction and an arena in which cultural production (and social debates) still take the form of narrative. What is “Britain” at the start of the twenty-first century, in what is ostensibly a post-war, post-imperial, and post-modern era? How do fiction writers respond to the twin pulls of national nostalgia and multicultural, intersectional identities? How do experiments in narrative form and genre speak to the emergence of new social and political formations? How does contemporary British fiction adapt or respond to a longer (and well-established) lineage of UK novelists (from Austen and Dickens to Virginia Woolf)? This course focuses on British fiction published after 1980, including works by authors who identify as Black British, queer, feminist, Muslim, and immigrant. Possible authors include Zadie Smith, A.

We will read several twentieth-century novels in which characters telling stories function as means of reforming community. In novels and anthropological study, we will pay particular attention to the ways that storytelling can reconceive identities of individuals and of history, at times opening up both so that persons and history become diverse and extensive. The boundaries of community may also become extensive, resisting containment and refusing to conform to a common cultural identity. We will read Walter Benjamin’s essay “The Storyteller” as well as several critical essays focusing on storytelling. Novels will include William Faulkner’s The Hamlet and Absalom, Absalom, Michael Ondaatje’s The English Patient, and Toni Morrison’s Paradise.

First, students will choose a contemporary practice, tool, or genre in which print and digital media have converged (e.g. book lists on Goodreads, e-book hardware, \"Twitter fiction\"), exploring what if anything is \"new\" about it. Next, student groups will design and prototype a digital technology that reimagines the ways that literature is produced or consumed in the context of digital media. This project will accommodate students with varying levels of technical expertise, though no programming experience is presumed. Throughout the course, readings on the history of media, the ethnography of literacy, and human-computer interaction will guide both our writing and production.",

    "description": "In 1738, a hundred years before legal emancipation came to England’s New World slave colonies, Jamaica’s Maroons forced the colonial power to sign a treaty granting sovereignty to Maroon communities across the Caribbean island. As the first Africans in the New World to achieve this feat, Maroon warriors directly and indirectly influenced abolitionist and revolutionary movements throughout the Americas—including, of course, revolts in Haiti and the United States. These warriors continued to inspire the revolutionary actions of other oppressed and/or enslaved individuals for generations, and indeed, a revolutionary ethos pervades Jamaican culture and artistic production from the colonial period to the present moment. This course traces the impact of “Jamaican” revolutionary figures on other revolutionary figures and events worldwide. Moving chronologically, from colonialism to the present day, the course examines influences such as African/Jamaican Maroon leaders direct impact on other revolutions throughout the Americas; Mary Seacole’s exchanges with and impact on Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War; Marcus Garvey’s impact on the Harlem Renaissance and the Rastafari religion; Claude McKay’s revolutionary impact on vernacular poetics and on the “Red Scare;” Louise Bennett’s mid-twentieth century revolutionary, feminist, vernacular poetics and her impact on female performers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa; Bob Marley and Damian Marley’s impact on politics and revolutionary movements in Liberia and Ghana; and finally, the impact of Staceyann Chin’s outspoken poetics on LGBTQ rights in the Caribbean and in other marginalized African diasporic communities.",

Are these texts in fact revolutionary? Are any of the texts politically or socially conservative, or do they represent conservative characters or perspectives? Do they take revolutionary forms or structures? To what extent are the texts participating in the same public sphere and historical moment? In responding to these questions, this colloquium will read literary texts (by Gaskell, Dickens, Emily Bronte, Christina Rossetti, Browning, and Tennyson) alongside artistic and political manifestos, popular political poetry, visual images, scientific and critical prose, and contemporary literary criticism (feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, poststructuralist).

Women writers of this time were keen observers of the social codes that formed—and constrained—their identities. Though women wrote in many genres in this period, this course will focus on major novels of the nineteenth century because of the particular strategies female novelists used to open up hard questions about social identity, and particularly social possibilities for women. Questions about gender clearly implicate sexuality, class, ethnicity, race, and power, as well, in complex, compelling, and unexpected ways.

Is sex or power more predominant in human relations? Why do we put ourselves in harm’s way despite our better intentions? Are life’s worst experiences always immitigable injustices, or are they potentially transformative? When, if ever, is a traumatic episode ‘past’?

In this course, discussions will focus on the times and the culture in which she wrote and on her more recent popularity.  Topics will include Austen's reactions against Romanticism; her continuing exploration of the moral and emotional dynamics of domestic life; her concern with the freedom of middle-class women; her use of history; her innovations in fictional narrative; and translations of her fiction into film.  We will read Northanger Abbey (written 1797, published 1818), Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814),  Emma (1816), and Persuasion, (written 1816, published 1818), and view film versions of Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Persuasion.   Dist: LIT; WCult: W  Course Group II",

    "description": "In Victorian England, a person’s face was his or her calling card: a clue to social identity, a signifier of inner personality, or a mask, a socially-constructed and performed persona. The period witnessed the expansion of photography, the popularity of pseudo-sciences such as physiognomy and phrenology, and the “scientific” study of race—disciplines that focused on the policing of a material body. At the same time, the Victorian period witnessed the emergence of an alternative vector of realism that rejected an emphasis on the “seen” and expanded the categories of who and what could be represented: women, industrial workers, and people of color. In analyzing these competing fields of realism, this colloquium will read literary texts alongside artistic manifestos, scientific and pseudo-scientific prose, visual images, and contemporary literary criticism (poststructuralist, psychoanalytic, feminist, queer, performance theory, critical race). Possible authors include Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, Amy Levy, and Bram Stoker.",

From the recent Hollywood blockbuster 12 Years a Slave (2013) to the streets of Ferguson and Baltimore, the legacies of slavery and racial violence continue to cast their shadow over horizons of emancipationist history even as America commemorates the sesquicentennial of the U.S. Civil War. In this course we will revisit the literatures of slavery and antislavery in the Atlantic world from the eighteenth century to the present. Our novels and stories imagine episodes of slavery, slave rebellion, and fugitive flights to freedom across two centuries: from early transatlantic crossings of slaves and servants to the New World; to Tacky’s Revolt and its place in what Vincent Brown has recently called the “Coromantee Archipelago” in eighteenth century slave rebellion; to the spectacular soundings of the Haiti Revolution in the Age of Revolutions; to the messianic prophecies of Nat Turner in the early nineteenth century; to slave rebellions at sea; and finally to fugitive slave fictions in the abolitionist decade leading up to the Civil War.",

It examines the ways in which both finance (especially speculation) and literature believe in the reality of fiction.

Students will have the opportunity to design a project dealing with issues of financial literacy. Possible readings/viewings include: Theodore Dreiser’s The Financier, Gary Shteyngart’s Super Sad True Love Story, William Gibson’s Peripheral, The Big Short (dir.

We will begin by examining revolutionary nationalist and anti-imperialist culture in the Americas—ranging from the memoirs of Che Guevara and Malcolm X to Nuyorican and Chicano Movement literature—in order to consider the formation of revolutionary subjects, and how 20th century ideas of revolution were raced and gendered. We will then consider how novelists, artists, photographers, filmmakers, and activists attempted to imagine solidarity with revolutionary movements and suffering others in the Americas, from Central America solidarity photography to performance art in solidarity with Guantanamo Bay prisoners. We will pay special attention to the work of feminist and queer solidarity artists, writers, and performers. Finally, we will examine contemporary activist cultural projects, such as PanAmerican public art road trips and hashtag-activism.

We will consider both traditional forms of Gothic representation (in works by Poe, O’Connor, Faulkner, etc.) as well as contemporary resurgences in the vampires, zombies, and other necrotic forms of recent literature, television, film, and other media.

And while no one reads Stevens for his “bric-a-brac” many readers come to Frost for his subjects, which have been misunderstood and sentimentalized over time. It is important to remember, reading him now, that Frost’s New England was no Transcendental retreat, and no rural paradise; poor, depopulated by western expansion on the one hand, and the industrialization of mill towns on the other, it was a landscape of failed and abandoned farmsteads, old people and misfits left to fend on their own, worn-out fields, harsh climate, intellectually moribund and spiritually enervated. Frost came to this “subject” without illusions or bitterness and it is through this subject that we will begin to rethink his poetics and ideas. Using the extensive Frost archives in Rauner, students will be encouraged to undertake primary research alongside their reading of poems and criticism. The course will culminate in a substantial research paper or project, individually designed in consultation with the instructor.",

This course explores the psychoanalytic case study as a unique literary genre in its own right, one that falls between the medical case history and the novel proper. We will read Sigmund Freud's case studies through three modes of reading: psychoanalytic feminist criticism; paranoid and reparative reading from queer critique; and, symptomatic reading from Marxist criticism. The readings of the cases will therefore be supplemented by texts in queer and feminist theory, continental philosophy, and literary criticism. Throughout the quarter, we will use the cases to explore questions of racial and sexual difference, the body, trauma, the psyche, and memory.",

Given that we can never get inside the head (or leaf) of another species, can we really know anything about their consciousness? Writers and theorists have been asking these questions for centuries, often in dialogue with the science of animal behavior. This course looks at a contemporary multidisciplinary tradition that attributes sentience and communication to animals, plants, and fungi. Over the course of the term, we address three interlocking problems as they appear in a varied archive of print and visual media 1) the problem of accessing the subjective experience of other species 2) the problem of communicating with other species, and the question in what media it might be possible 3) the problem of communicating with other human beings about 1 and 2, and the question of what media best serve this purpose. We also ask what these aesthetic and theoretical traditions offer us now, during the “Anthropocene” or the current epoch when humans have become a geological force shaping the Earth. We ask whether or not they have the potential to interpret it from a different perspective, whether or not they can inform environmentalist politics, and what their implications might be for social justice.

Why has walking long been regarded as a vehicle for thought and discourse: a privileged mechanism of knowledge production? Is there a difference between a country walk and a city walk? What is the relationship between walking and time, walking and place? Why should walking have emerged, in certain works of contemporary literature, as a principled rejection of mechanization, modernity, and the capitalist mode of production? And what does walking mean for those who cannot walk? To address these questions, students will read texts by such practitioners and theorists of walking as Thoreau, Walter Benjamin, W. G. Sebald, Rebecca Solnit, Simon Armitage, Robert MacFarlane, Geoff Nicholson, and others.

There were wars and border skirmishes; the Norman and Angevin kings of England sought to subdue the Celtic kingdoms and extend their political influence by diplomacy, coercion and conquest, creating a dynamic that is in some ways parallel to, but also interestingly different from a modern Colonial/Postcolonial situation.  Readings may include early Arthurian material; Diarmaid and Grainne and the Anglo-French Tristan romances; Geoffrey of Monmouth's Life of Merlin and Merlinesque prophecies; the Welsh Mabinogi; lais by Marie de France and other writers; the borderland romance \"Fulk Fitz Warren\"; the anecdotes, satires and short romances of Walter Map; Gerald of Wales's ethnographic descriptions/ travelogues of Wales and Ireland.  All non-English texts will be read in translation, although students with some knowledge of French, Latin, or a Celtic language may wish to explore some readings in the original. Enrollment limited to 12.",

In this seminar we'll read Ovid's Heroides and Metamorphoses in the sixteenth and early seventeenth century print translations alongside a modern English edition. (Students competent in Latin may use the Loeb as well as or instead of the modern English.) We'll consider the forms, themes, and predicaments Ovid's great mythographic poems offered to the English literary imagination. Some attention will be paid to late 20th century performative and poetic \"englishings\" of Ovid.",

By the 1890s, the figure of the Bohemian had become central to a cosmopolitan literary culture eager to assert its autonomy from the marketplace and restrictive notions of nationality. It had also become bound up with a range of anxieties fixated on cultural decadence, racial degeneration, transgressive sexuality, political revolution and the occult. This course will study a series of novels that foreground these issues, including Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, George Gissing's New Grub Street, George Du Maurier's Trilby and Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent.

From The Scarlet Letter (1850) and Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1851-52) to Leaves of Grass (1855) and Lincoln’s “House Divided” Speech of 1858, the literary output of America in the 1850s provides us with a snapshot of a turbulent culture amidst unprecedented growth and crisis. Slavery and xenophobia, minstrelsy and mass entertainments, crowds, consumerism, and cities, the “woman question,” labor rights, economic panics, and the secularization of Christian sentiment—these are just some of the issues that clamor in the literature of the decade. Our texts shall represent the gorgeous miscellany that is the 1850s, drawing from both high and low culture, canonical and forgotten authors, and from both established genres and media like novels and slave narratives to more ephemeral ones like newspapers, almanacs, caricatures, and inscribed material objects. Classes will meet in Rauner so that we may use these and other period rarities to spawn discussion and topics for original, independent research. In addition to the rich content of the texts themselves (their historical contexts and theoretical possibilities), another object of inquiry shall be the nature of literary history itself.",

First, we will spend the term engaging in an intensive, deliberately slow reading of Dickens’s Bleak House, which was published from March, 1852 to September, 1853, in 20 monthly parts. By spreading our reading of this long, complex novel over the span of the fall term, we will gain access to something like the experience of its first readers, who encountered the text in units of several chapters, separated by time. Second, we will put Dickens and Bleak House in conversation with three other novelists and novels that shared the moment in the marketplace: Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford, published serially and edited by Dickens in 1851-52, Charlotte Brontë’s Villette, published in 1853, and Anthony Trollope’s Barchester Towers, published in 1855. Through work in Rauner Library, we will learn about the material history of literary production in the mid-Victorian period, and through engagement with contemporary critical and theoretical texts, we will learn about the implications of the narrative experiments Dickens, Gaskell, Brontë, and Trollope undertook in the 1850s. Though reading for the course will be demanding, keeping up will be rewarded with ample room for lively in-class discussions.",

In this course, we will look closely at the literary production of the Brontës, beginning with the fantastical tales and poetry they wrote as young adults. Topics will include female labor, evangelicalism, the Victorian Gothic, marriage and women’s legal rights, storytelling and myth, colonialism, feminized and racialized madness, and the physical and psychological contours of domestic and foreign space.",

Just a year before, though, James Agee and Walker Evans -- a journalist and photographer -- had published Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, a vast book, indeed, sprawling in its feverish devotion to the experimentation Agee and Evans believed necessary to even come close to telling a true story. Agee and Evans wanted it to be an object as much as a book, a challenge to literary culture; whatever it was, it wasn't \"sub\" anything. In this course we'll use the question of just what Agee's and Evan's combination of pictures and words might be as the heart of our exploration of the documentary sphere as encountered through the conjunction of text and image. In the first half of the course, we’ll be guided by critical thinkers as we look at creative works and write our own critical essays; in the second, we’ll be guided by creative work as we attempt our own even while we continue our conversations with more contemporary critical thinkers. Besides Agee and Evans, we’ll be encountering among others, photographers Robert Frank, Sally Mann, Stephen Shore, Helen Levitt, Wendy Ewald, Teju Cole, Jean Mohr, Tanja Hollander, and Roy DeCarava; literary journalists Leslie Jamison, Michael Lesy, John Jeremiah Sullivan, John Berger, and Charles Bowden; critics Susan Sontag, Roland Barthes, John Szarkowski, Jerry Thompson, Susie Linfield, Jeff Allred, and bell hooks; and poets Claudia Rankine, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, Donald Justice, and Kevin Young.",

Yet the contexts of many of these utterances are largely ignored. Delving into some of these contexts and engaging many of these artists’ larger oeuvre, this course is a multidisciplinary investigation of major protest poets of the twentieth century. It explores the ways in which poets living in the United States, and particularly members of historically marginalized communities, not only pushed back at the powers-that-be, but continuously saw and articulated themselves as simultaneously a part of and a part from larger “American” society. The course wrestles with the well-known and often contentious topics: race, class, and gender. Starting with turn-of-the-century writers like Claude McKay—whose words have become synonymous with outspoken critiques of World War I and the “Red Scare”—and ending with contemporary writers like Balakian and Chin, the course moves chronologically. Some of the writers it examines include, Peter Balakian, Amiri Baraka, Staceyann Chin, Lucille Clifton, Mayda Del Valle, Karen Garrabrant, Allen Ginsberg, Zbignew Herbert, Robert Lowell, Juan Felipe Herrera, Langston Hughes, Etheridge Knight, Denise Levertov, Haki Madhubuti, Jill McDonough, Claude McKay, Alice Notley, Emmy Perez, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Sonia Sanchez, and Dorothy Tse.",

    "description": "Why read Freud? Many of his most famous ideas (the Oedipus Complex, for example) have been discredited, disparaged, devalued, decried. So why read Freud? Using that question — a question that, in its very persistence, already crystalizes all that is most troubling, provocative, and intriguing about the Freudian text — students in this class will read Freud for his enduring value as the inventor, in psychoanalysis, of one of modernity’s most disturbing art forms, as an influential theorist of figuration and representation, as a fearless inquirer into the mysteries of gender and sexuality, and as a speculative thinker who continues to have a hold on our imagination precisely because he could never quite come to grips with all that had a hold on his imagination. Above all, we shall read Freud for what he has to teach us about the importance of risking failure and embarrassment, of remaining restless and uncertain in respect to one’s own thinking, of finding oneself in over one’s head. The texts we shall use to pursue this line of inquiry may or may not include any of the following: Studies on Hysteria, The Interpretation of Dreams, Three Essays on Sexuality, the case histories of Dora and the Wolf Man, Papers on Metapsychology and on Technique, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety, Civilization and Its Discontents, and essays such as “Project for a Scientific Psychology,” “Screen Memories,” “The Uncanny,” “The Moses of Michelangelo,” “On Narcissism,” “Two Principles of Mental Functioning,” “A Child Is Being Beaten,” “The Economic Problem of Masochism,” “Constructions in Analysis,” “Analysis Terminal and Interminable,” and “Humor.”",

Healthcare, reproduction, immigration, security, racialization, risk management, emotional wellbeing, property and the common: There is no aspect of embodied existence that has not been affected, if not created (or at least grasped), by biopolitics. Nevertheless, the concept of biopolitics itself, introduced into the critical lexicon by Foucault and still subject to revision and working-through, remains far from settled. Accordingly, students in this seminar will read foundational texts of the burgeoning biopolitical canon — texts by Foucault, Arendt, Agamben, Esposito, Hardt and Negri, to name but a few — as a way of understanding biopolitics not as the basis for a new epistemology but as the term we accord a set of predicaments that emerge at the point where politics and life intercept one another. To facilitate that understanding, students will rely on the texts collected in Biopolitics: A Reader, supplemented by Esposito’s Terms of the Political and Melinda Cooper’s Life as Surplus. For their final paper, students will have the option of writing either an essay assessing the treatment of a biopolitical predicament across a range of texts or a biopolitical case study.",

    "description": "Words in dialogue with images pervade our textual landscape in the form of advertisements, comics, instructional diagrams, and photo essays, and the entanglement of symbol systems once thought of as separate has become routine in digital display. Word-image theory seeks to understand these entanglements, analyzing the conceptual intersections of the literary and the visual. In this seminar, students will be invited to re-conceptualize those intersections by becoming familiar with the core arguments of word-image studies, iconology, picture theory, and visual culture studies. Creative authors may include Chris Ware, Claudia Rankine, and W.G. Sebald, and critical authors may include Panofsky, Barthes, Foucault, Mitchell, and Bal.",

In the course, we will read Fanon’s early essays on black subjectivity in Black Skin, White Masks; his more overtly political writings on violence and revolution in Wretched of the Earth; and, his clinical writings on madness, institutionalization, and psychotherapy, collected in the newly translated Alienation and Freedom. Throughout the course of the term, we will pay close attention to questions of racial and sexual difference in Fanon’s work as well as the way his writing remains critical for postcolonial political thought.",

But how is this genre new, and why limit such queries to fiction? How does the specter of species death and global pandemonium have a literary and cultural history as well as a geophysical, earth systems one? This seminar, through historical and contemporary critique, read transversally across an array of media from novels to theory and film, will situate where we are now with literature from the past about the emergence of steam power, land enclosures, energy systems, and Arctic exploration to account for how we might secure the future. Topics include entanglements of anthopogenic processes with other planetary effects in theories of Capitalocene, Plantationocene, and Chthulucene from the conquest of the Americas to the untimely present. Readings include eighteenth century and romantic natural history, bad weather, contemporary “cli-fi,” ecological theory, and at least one film, such as Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster Ready Player One (2018).",

    "description": "The relationship between humans and the environment is mediated by the consumption of natural resources, the discharge of pollution and waste, and the transformation of landscapes and ecosystems. Unsustainable outcomes arise because individuals and organizations have incentives to undertake actions that degrade environmental quality, often in the context of markets. As a result, achieving sustainability requires laws, public policies, social norms, and shared understandings that align individual action with collective well-being. This course analyzes the causes and solutions of environmental problems through the integration of concepts from a variety of social science disciplines. In addition, it explores the central role that ecology and ecosystem science play in understanding and responding to sustainability challenges.",

The success of environmental law depends upon balancing the three components of sustainability: ecological, economic, and social/cultural. Today, the primary sources of this balancing act are federal, state, and local ordinances and their myriad regulations. However, these statutes and regulations overlay a common, judge-made, law of property that establishes a system of private and public property, a law of contracts that governs transactions, and a tort law that provides remedies for intentional and unintentional harms. In addition, there is a growing body of international environmental law with both similarities and differences to U.S. environmental law. The major objectives of this course are to survey today's major environmental laws, explore their history, determine how well they balance ecological, economic, and social sustainability and, finally, to discuss how to improve environmental law to better deal with biodiversity loss, human population growth, energy needs, and climate change in the future.

Agriculture and land management has increased soil erosion around the world, potentially influencing the history and fate of civilizations. In the modern era, this use is not sustainable; the physical and chemical degradation of soils far outpaces soil production. This course will explore the nature and properties of soils and examine how these processes occur in natural and human-influenced soils, and identify reasonable limits on what can influence the sustainable utilization of soils as a resource. We will begin by developing an understanding of the geologic, biologic, and chemical processes that lead to soil formation and the development of specific soil properties. The second portion of the course will examine the relationship between soils and underlying bedrock and overlying vegetation and the role of soils in ecosystems. The final section of the course will examine the situations in which soils are used to reduce the impact of human activities and the way in which humans can reduce their impact on soils: the importance of soils in septic tanks and leach fields; the use of soils as solid waste landfill caps and liners; the use of soils in the storage of hazardous wastes; and the conservation and management of soils.",

The course will also trace the pervasive presence of noir and its continuing appeal for artists and audiences throughout the world.

We will examine the history of Mexican film, filmmaking practices, aesthetics and business concerns, as well as audiences inside and outside of Mexico. One central point of inquiry will be the extent to which Mexican cinema was truly \"national.\" We will question the concept of “national cinema” all the while analyzing the extent to which issues in Mexican politics, society, and culture were reflected on and influenced by the screen. The transnationality of Mexican film will be central to our investigation as we examine the influence of the United States and Hollywood during Mexican cinema’s development. Students will learn about the various styles and genres of Mexican film and the theories with which film scholars have interpreted them. Among the filmmakers to be studied are Sergei Eisenstein, Fernando de Fuentes, Emilio “El Indio” Fernandez, Luis Buñuel, Alfonso Arau, Maria Novaro, Natalia Almada, Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón, and Alejandro Gonzales-Iñárritu.

In this interdisciplinary course, you will learn about the ‘new Russia’ that has emerged in the three decades since that stunning collapse. Drawing on a wide variety of resources in English translation—from Russian films and novels to YouTube videos and social media posts—you will navigate the diverse technologies and media products that are helping to shape contemporary Russian identity. You will explore, for example, the ‘violent entrepreneurship’ of oil oligarchs, the cynicism of state-funded television propagandists, and the avant-garde theatrics of Moscow’s feminist dissidents. Your study of Putin’s Russia should also allow us to discuss some of the most pressing questions facing citizens in a democracy today: What is the nature of truth in the digital age? How do content creators and media consumers determine what is credible? What factors and forces are shaping the messages we consume through our televisions, tablets, and smartphones, and how can we learn to critically evaluate these messages in order to lead better lives?",

It takes as its main example “one of the largest and most dramatic mass migrations to this country in the twentieth century,” namely that of some 130,000 German-speaking refugees who arrived on these shores between 1933 and 1945. The course will examine several of the most significant areas that were influenced by this vital cultural shift: the American academy and intellectual life; the film industry (“Weimar on the Pacific,” as Hollywood was sometimes called); and, more generally, the political and cultural debates concerning the “German Question,” i.e., what to do with Germany after the war. We will explore how the exiles viewed their role and how they viewed the interplay between American and European culture.",

    "description": "This course is an introduction to the history of race and gender in American film. These fundamental social constructs in American life have been central to the development of American film narrative from the beginnings of cinema at the turn of the twentieth century. In turn, American films have profoundly shaped the ways that we think about race and gender and racialized and gendered beings. We will analyze the shifting and situational meanings of race and gender throughout the twentieth century, and in particular, how they have been influenced by the forces of history, including wars, economic depressions, and social movements. While we will focus our attention on Hollywood cinema of the “golden age”, the period from the 1920s-1960, we will also spend significant time considering American independent cinema and the post-classical period of filmmaking from the 1960s to the present. In our consideration of race and racialized peoples, we will include African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Latinos. Our discussions of gender will be expansive to include not just women and femininity, but men and masculinity as well.",

It is also suitable for students with little or no knowledge of the French language, but who have a strong background in another Romance language (i.e. Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Portuguese, Catalan, and also Latin).  French 11 is an accelerated course that combines French 1 and 2 in one term, offering an exciting and fast-paced atmosphere in which to learn French. The course will have a web-based component, which, through cultural, grammar and multimedia learning activities, will complement face-to-face work and prepare students for in-class work. Students will learn to talk about familiar events in the present and the past, as well as formulate plans for the future. Weekly cultural videos will situate in context the grammatical content of the course, making it relevant and meaningful. Students will be actively engaged in a variety of creative written and oral activities that will help them develop their language skills. Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to sign up for French 3 or apply for our French LSAs in Lyon or Toulouse.

We will study miscreants who single-mindedly pursue their destructive goals. By examining how literature and music represent misogyny, we will pay particular attention to what constitutes “bad” behavior, to what initiates such behavior, and to the moral and social implications of such behavior. At the same time, we will discuss how the “good” aesthetics of “bad” (the way in which aesthetic beauty) is made from the raw materials of social and psychological malefaction. These broader questions will help frame our thematic investigation of misbehavior, with discussions on vices such as rakishness, hubris, greed and narcissism. We will focus on how literary and musical genres portray these vices, and then take note of how vices attain an ambiguous meaning within the social and moral systems of these works.",

The unprecedented fusion Dante made of these elements in the Commedia [The Divine Comedy] has guaranteed his great poem a vast public, extending across world cultures and the seven centuries since it initially traveled among elite readers in north-central Italy in the early decades of the fourteenth century. This course will first examine the development of Dante’s poetic voice in La vita nova [The New Life, ca. 1293-94] and then focus on its subsequent expansion into an all-encompassing vision of life and death in Inferno [Hell, ca. 1306-09], the first of the three canticles of the Commedia. Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante’s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why – in the words of Italo Calvino – it “has not finished saying what it has to say.” Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work – to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project – will be in English.

Both physically and symbolically, city walls separate the world of citizens, societies, and cultures from the uncultivated land, the wild beasts, and the illiterate savages that lie without. But how solid are these walls? And how real or even desirable are the distinctions they seek to make? We may prefer the civilized to the wild, but do we not also, paradoxically, prefer the natural to the artificial? Is nature to be dominated, or revered? Is it our nemesis or our mother? Exploring texts in the Italian tradition, this course will trace the history of nature from the beginning of civilization to the present time, and uncover our ever changing, ever contradictory opinions about it.",

    "description": "The fairy tale is among the oldest and most enduring forms of narrative, a prototype of how we tell stories and of how we reflect on our human condition. Fairy tales are uniquely “in” and “out” of the world; their matter-of-fact mash-up of realistic and fantastic elements is an invitation to imagine dimensions different from the here-and-now. As such, they are a potent vehicle for the expression of cultural aspirations and anxieties as well as for the construction and subversion of ideologies and identities.\nThis course is a study of the rich and precocious Italian fairy-tale tradition, the very first to take literary form in Europe. Along the way we will address questions concerning canon formation; the role of “marvelous” genres such as the fairy tale in socialization and the expression of national identity; the relation between oral folk narratives and written literary tales; and the reworking of fairy-tale subjects and motifs in contemporary culture. We will also acquaint ourselves with a variety of critical approaches to the fairy tale, and consider some of the other European fairy-tale traditions, especially the French and the German.",

The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change. In the last part of the class, we will focus on how global environmental changes generate impacts at the local scale, and how small-scale transformations propagate into large-scale global environmental issues.",

This course explores the interaction of geography and politics, including the origin and function of nations and states, policing and social control, federalism, the role and status of racial and ethnic minorities, political representation and electoral redistricting. Through such topics, the class addresses questions regarding the nature of power, identity, democratic theory and the relationship between the individual and the state. We will focus particular attention on issues of scale, or how the application of territorial strategies at different spatial levels affects political relationships.",

The aim of this course is to study the problem of violence through a geographic lens. it explores a range of topics relating to violence at three scales: the global, the national, and the body. The goal is to interrogate how each scale of unit of analysis reveals different ways of understanding violence and to draw connections between them; and the course will focus particular attention on the historical and political geographies of Western violence.

What ideological and technical tools have been used to transform native territories? How have national development programs shaped experience in settler-colonial contexts? Finally, how has native sovereignty been articulated through indigenous development efforts? We will draw on examples from the Americas, Africa, and Asia to understand how place-based development has been part of global networks of imperialism and resistance.",

    "description": "The purpose of this course is to describe and examine the manifold ways that environmental alterations have occurred - over both geologic and historical timescales. Considerable research over the past several decades has shown that anthropogenic disturbance has significantly modified natural processes frequently leading to degraded conditions. The goal of the course is first to establish that shifts in climate, vegetation, and landscapes are \"natural\" and have occurred over geologic time and that the timing and magnitude of these shifts provides the necessary background to evaluate the type, magnitude, and frequency of anthropogenic disturbance. The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change. In the last part of the class, we will focus on how global environmental changes generate impacts at the local scale, and how small-scale transformations propagate into large-scale global environmental issues.",

This course draws on Cultural Geography and Film and Media Studies in order to interrogate this development. Through a variety of readings and screenings of films and TV shows, we will be examining American downtowns, suburbs, and homes as sites for the construction of classed, racialized, sexualized and gendered identities in three different time periods: the early 20th century, the post WWII era, and the contemporary period. We will interrogate such topics as: the real and imagined role of “shopping” women and gender in the shaping of modern downtowns; the relationship between the American suburb, new sexual identities and the film Pillow Talk; and how a particular nostalgia for the past that has led to the popularity of such shows as Mad Men can also be seen on the streets of Hanover (neo-traditional urbanism).",

Why might a medical practitioner analyze novels in addition to analyzing patients? Our goals for this course are twofold: First, we will work to understand Freud’s texts on their own terms as we familiarize ourselves with psychoanalytic theories. Second, we will situate these works within a broader cultural context, reading them alongside literary texts that Freud explicitly addresses and alongside literary, filmic, and theoretical works that draw on psychoanalytic concepts. Our discussions of the cultural imprint of Freudian thought will encompass a variety of themes, from gender and sexuality to Jewishness to the clinical techniques central to psychoanalytic practice. We will grapple with the promises and limitations of Freud’s own literary “archive” and the cultural products that archive Freudian thought.",

We will situate each theme in its historical and literary context and investigate in what ways imagining sexual desires beyond the publicly acceptable may be read 1) as a call for non-conformism and rebellion against the repressive politics of the state exacted on the individual subject, 2) as a response against the psycho-medical field’s narrow labeling of sexual desires as degenerate perversions of middle class morals, 3) as cautionary tales that aim to redress such perceived acts of deviance and reestablish the moral order of the majority and 3) as artistic expression of that which is fundamentally human, i.e. the wide range of human sensory perception between the self and the other, which leads to such desires. The fictional material will be supplemented by medical, legal and political texts that seek to classify, regulate and fight for the expression of sexual relationships that are considered “beyond the norm.”",

It will then look at the succession of thinkers who, having embraced the novel scientific methods of the day, sought to understand economic affairs as themselves governed by scientific laws; and who then sought to ground the legitimacy of commonwealths in laws, regulations and interventions that engendered wealth. One goal of the course is to familiarize students with foundational thinkers who gave us the discipline of economics: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Mill, and Spencer.

    "description": "Since John F. Kennedy’s 1961 executive order to implement affirmative action policies, institutions of higher education have looked for ways to encourage minority and low-income students to matriculate. Some institutions, such as such as Harvard, UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and UMichigan, have experienced lawsuits against the policy’s implementation. As universities stress their desire for diverse, well-rounded, high achieving classes and continue to implement methods to attract highly qualified students, there is disagreement about which methods are both effective and fair. How can educational administrators, parents and community members work together to improve college access and increase equality? Do we still need to “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are…treated…without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\" or has affirmative action outlived its original purpose? Has the college access gap widened or shrunk? Are students’ experiences on campus living up to the goal of equal opportunity? This course will explore the topic of affirmative action through some traditional classroom techniques (reading/ writing/ discussion) as well as experiential education techniques (such as creating a public policy portfolio project, having conversations with professionals who administer affirmative action at colleges and universities, and pitching proposals to a panel of policy experts).\n\\fThe central work of the course involves creating a portfolio of venues to explore, design, publicize, and promote an affirmative action or anti-discrimination policy/program. Completing the course readings and discussions will develop the skills necessary to complete the portfolio. Throughout the course, students will work in small groups to develop a policy campaign using techniques from writing to video to speeches. This course design attempts to raise students’ awareness of the multiple communication modes for making a compelling and persuasive policy proposal. To create their portfolios, students must advance an issue, demonstrate the techniques they have used to study and develop it, and effectively persuade their audience of the policy/program’s value.

Covering more than a two hundred year stretch, we will move across an expansive geography encompassing North Africa, the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Central Asia. Throughout this journey, particular attention will be paid to five important themes: imperialism, modernization, nationalism, Islam, and revolution. In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region’s dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior exploring the impact, importance and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the “Arab Spring” and its aftermath. Whenever possible, we will strive to illuminate ordinary people, as opposed to only elite actors, who contributed to the making of the modern Middle East.",

Dictatorship is usually described as a strongman imposing his will on the nation through sheer force. French political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie (1530–1563) in his seminal essay Discours de la servitude volontaire (Discourse on Voluntary Servitude) presented the existence of a dictatorship as a relationship between two parties. Before every dictator is a population that is willing to accept rule by the dictator. The dictator cannot impose his will on a people that shun a dictatorship. Extrapolating from this concept, we can consider dictatorship to be a syndrome. The dictionary defines a syndrome as “a group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality or condition.” In this course, students will examine the condition, signs, symptoms, and cures for the malady of dictatorship.",

The most recent financial crisis has put into question many of the assertions on both sides of this debate, in ways that question the very basic assumptions analysts of the global economy have been making since the creation of the Bretton Woods system in the aftermath of World War II. In this course we investigate the impact of the economic boom of the last two decades, the current crisis, and their impact on the economic fate and standing of particularly the United States, India, China, and Russia. We focus in part on efforts to create a new financial architecture for the global economy, and investigate how the debate between markets and state intervention has been affected by the ongoing financial crisis-and what this may mean for both countries that rely extensively on markets, and for those that strategically promote state intervention.",

Case studies include escalation in Vietnam, assessments of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs, and the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound. As we analyze and critique foreign policy, we seek to develop broader intuitions for making better decisions in everyday contexts.\nThe course spans three units. Unit 1 surveys conceptual lenses in the study of decision making from the standpoints of cost-benefit analysis, organizational behavior, domestic politics, culture, and psychology. Unit 2 surveys tools for foreign policy analysis, including intelligence, threat perception, and political forecasting. Unit 3 examines how that analysis is used and misused when making and executing policy decisions.",

The second section of the course will focus on di\\uFB00erent empirical approaches to studying representation. The third section focuses on the relationship between inequality (along lines of race/ethnicity, gender, and class) and representation.

Scholars and practitioners debate how much of an “order” it actually is or ever was, how “liberal” it is or ever was, and how “global” it is or ever was. But there is widespread consensus that it has reached an inflection point — that the system will look different twenty years from now than it does today. This course will examine the debates over what that future will and should look like, and in particular what steps need to be taken to improve the international order’s capacity with respect to its three core functions: (1) to manage disputes and reduce violent conflict, (2) to mobilize action to address shared challenges like climate change, and (3) to establish rules of the road that govern interstate and transnational conduct in key areas, from trade to nuclear proliferation. To this end, we will look at changes in the distribution of power between states (including the rise of China), the diffusion of power beyond states (including the role of technology), and the crisis of governance within states (including the rise of populism and nationalism).

    "description": "This collaborative and team-taught course seeks to introduce advanced undergraduates to cutting-edge research on topics by leading experts in international conflict. Taking advantage of an online format, the course features instructors from 11 different universities. The course is organized around important theoretical and empirical puzzles in world politics, including why states go to war, why they win, the rise of China, and how new technologies like robotics and artifficial intelligence will shape the future of the international order. Each week features a new topic and a series of online (asynchronous) lectures and (live) discussion seminars. Dartmouth students will thus have the pportunity to hear lectures from leading experts and to participate in a joint, all-university, weekly discussion section led by each professor. We will also have a separate online discussion for Dartmouth students only that I will lead.",

Students will examine the arguments of authors advocating special political and legal treatment for cultural groups, integrated with responses from liberal, conservative, and feminist critics of multiculturalism. The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of central issues in multicultural debates; but its principal aim is to inspire students to think deeply about the principles, values, and institutions that democratic societies might affirm. Among the questions students consider will be the following: Is a multicultural society desirable or workable? Should government provide minority cultures with special recognition, legal exemptions, or group rights? Is multiculturalism bad for women or harmful otherwise? Could any form of multiculturalism adequately emphasize the values of personal autonomy, equality, and fairness? Prerequisite: one course in political theory or political philosophy.",

Viewing Native America as an incredibly complex series of borderlands is a useful interpretive model for better understanding the history of Native peoples. Lectures, readings, and class discussion will focus on elements such as cultural contact, conquest and colonialism, missionization, citizenship, gender, and nation. While exploring these various themes, we will touch on some familiar territory such as frontiers and middle grounds, but we will also question our own personal, and often, region-based expertise in order to unpack a more nuanced view of Indigenous borderlands and their significance.",

Students will read a variety of primary and secondary materials designed to familiarize them with the historical, cultural, and social processes that have affected and transformed the region in question, and will learn to put these regional histories in a global framework. The course begins with a brief summary of the early modern Islamicate “Gunpowder” Empires—Mughal, Safavid/Qajar, Ottoman—and then moves through several topics of significance: the era of European colonialism; the establishment of the nation state; competing discourses of nationalism; the emergence of Third Worldist and anti-colonial movements; the Israeli- Palestinian conflict; debates over the politics of gender; the effects of the Cold War; the processes of decolonization and the establishment of post-colonial states; the rise of revolutionary Islamism; oil politics and policies; globalization and neoliberalism; 9/11, terrorism, and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the Arab uprisings of 2010-2011; and the region’s uncertain present and future.",

It assesses the extent to which the sea served as an extensive nexus among various places and peoples rather than a vast barrier or boundary. With this in mind, it traces the dramatic arc of history during which Britain was transformed from a small cluster of insignificant islands on the margins of Europe into an important hub of global networks with profound social, economic, political and cultural influence. At the same time, the course considers the importance of the sea in bringing British subjects into closer contact with a wide variety of environments and peoples whose influences transformed British attitudes, aspirations, and practices at home and abroad. The course also explores how a dynamic relationship with the sea itself, as experienced by ordinary people of Britain and its global contacts, shaped how these people viewed themselves, their history, their surroundings, and the wider world.",

In doing so, we will situate the histories and social worlds of the region in a global frame, asking how global political and economic transformations have affected the region. At the same time that we attend closely to these histories, we will also examine the ways in which the category of “woman” has been mobilized in popular and political discourses in the 18th-21th centuries, paying particular attention to how Muslim and Middle Eastern women have been represented in various political discourses, as well as how they have represented themselves. Through close readings of both primary sources (in translation) and secondary literature — including historiographical, theoretical, and literary texts as well as film and music— we will also tackle the questions, controversies, and stereotypes that have animated debates in both scholarly and popular literature on such topics as the veil, feminism, revolution, human rights, LGBT issues, masculinity, and war.",

How did the religious and intellectual heritage of Korea legitimize hereditary status, slave ownership, gender division, and regional discrimination? In what ways did ordinary people conform to or struggle against elite governing?  Docs the longevity of the Chason dynasty testify to the successful control of the status system by those at the top? Or does the stability elucidate social mobility and dynamic interactions across the status divisions? Focusing on various status groups illuminates the mechanisms of domination, compliance, and resistance carried out at the micro level.

As a result, Barbuda was left uninhabitable, Puerto Rico’s unofficial death toll was estimated in the thousands, and Dominica resembled a war zone. Hundreds of thousands were left without electricity and potable water in a region that was already suffering from stagnating economies and humanitarian crises. These natural events and their unnatural consequences laid bare the region’s legacy of colonialism, underdevelopment, and failing infrastructures. Things will never go back to the way they were before. Yet, these events are hardly unique in the Caribbean and Latin American experience.\n\\fLatin America, and the Caribbean region within it, have not only been shaped by human development but also by natural events. Hurricanes and earthquakes—the two natural events this course focuses on—have transformed the region’s landscape.

Covering more than a two hundred year stretch, we will move across an expansive geography encompassing North Africa, the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Central Asia. Throughout this journey, particular attention will be paid to five important themes: imperialism, modernization, nationalism, Islam, and revolution. In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region’s dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior to exploring the impact, importance, and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the “Arab Spring” and its aftermath. Whenever possible, we will strive to illuminate ordinary people, as opposed to only elite actors, who contributed to the making of the modern Middle East.",

Rather than treating the experiences of black and white migrants separately, this course takes a comparative approach to these simultaneous and parallel migrations, focusing on the political and economic factors that drove out-migration from the South; the impact that southern migration had on race relations and labor markets in northern and western cities; the diasporic communities formed by southern migrants in their new homes; and the impact of the migrations on American culture and politics over the course of the 20th century.",

In part four, we will turn our attention to the modern era.

What were the factors leading to this juxtaposition of triumphal Independence with shameful Partition? What were the implications of Partition for ordinary people? How have memories of Partition continued to affect powerful politics and culture in the subcontinent? This seminar investigates such questions using a wide variety of materials including films, memoirs, fiction and scholarly works. This course follows recent scholarship in focusing on the long-term implications of Partition for the subcontinent. Hence, while we certainly will investigate the events leading up to Partition, our emphasis will be on understanding the effect of Partition on the lives of ordinary people during and after.",

To this end, we will look at rights movements in Middle East, Latin America, and Asian contexts, and attend to the often-complicated history of such movements in the context of imperialism and war. In this course, we will ask: What are human rights, and what is their history? What is the relationship between human rights and earlier languages of rights? What counts as a human right? Can there be a universal standard for human rights despite social difference? What political and ethical possibilities have been opened for marginalized communities by the language of human rights, and what possibilities have been foreclosed by the often-singular focus on human rights as a panacea against all social ills? And finally: do our demands for human rights work to make the world a more just place, and are these demands enough?",

At once a media history and a survey of key medieval and early modern textual genres, it explores the rich international media environment in which spoken, sung, handwritten, and printed news interacted and shaped the core features of the newspaper as we know it today. Analyzing genres such as chronicles, sermons, Khipu messages, letters, broadsides, travel writings, and ballads, the course investigates the relationship of news to historiography, theology, administrative practices, political activism, and entertainment. Topics will include news as a prerogative of elites vs. news as a medium of the masses; questions of veracity, manipulation, and trust; the production of news and colonialism; the relationship of news to time; and the emergence and managing of public opinion.",

The feature that characterizes and associates the two movements best is their awareness for how form impacts content, or, as Gertrude Stein said, “how writing is written.” The world comes into being and takes shape in the words we use, the texts we write, the images we produce, the movies we shoot, or the maps we draw to name only some of the signifying systems that give the universe a form.",

Never has the public sphere been so challenged, so weakened, so undermined by the logic of an all-encompassing economic rationale that has evolved from the abstraction of economic theory and its vision of unimaginable profits to the reality of dilapidated world economies and bankrupt social welfare systems. Given this blindness, it comes as no surprise that we would be living in times that do not pay enough attention to the humanities or to the aesthetic realm for they seem too \"removed\" from the day to day facts of \"reality.\" But let's think again. Who bears witness to the suffering and inequalities around us, to the walls that have been relentlessly erected to keep us all in place? Writers, filmmakers, documentarians, photographers, poets, individuals, who make \"energy\" (intellectual energy) usable in different places and contexts (Hutcheon). This course will cross disciplinary boundaries and follow the \"comparative method\" scrupulously. We will be reading literature with care and learning how to read literarily—with intensive textual scrutiny, defiance, and metatheoretical awareness (Saussy)—a wide array of theoretical and filmic texts. Our goal will be to travel from the theoretical to the particular and vice-versa, from the literary and filmic stories to the suprapersonal, to the wider polity and back to the personal, for these texts share a passion for change through recognizing our shared vulnerability and humanity.

The unprecedented fusion Dante made of these elements in the Commedia [The Divine Comedy] has guaranteed his great poem a vast public, extending across world cultures and the seven centuries since it initially traveled among elite readers in north-central Italy in the early decades of the fourteenth century. This course will first examine the development of Dante’s poetic voice in La vita nova [The New Life, ca. 1293-94] and then focus on its subsequent expansion into an all-encompassing vision of life and death in Inferno [Hell, ca. 1306-09], the first of the three canticles of the Commedia. Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante’s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why – in the words of Italo Calvino – it “has not finished saying what it has to say.” Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work – to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project – will be in English.

Both physically and symbolically, city walls separate the world of citizens, societies, and cultures from the uncultivated land, the wild beasts, and the illiterate savages that lie without. But how solid are these walls? And how real or even desirable are the distinctions they seek to make? We may prefer the civilized to the wild, but do we not also, paradoxically, prefer the natural to the artificial? Is nature to be dominated, or revered? Is it our nemesis or our mother? Exploring texts in the Italian tradition, this course will trace the history of nature from the beginning of civilization to the present time, and uncover our ever changing, ever contradictory opinions about it.",

We will thus analyze how Italian ecological narratives fit within the current transnational debate occurring in the Environmental Humanities.\nOur goal is to provide both an account of how Italian culture has shaped contemporary environmental thought and how Italian authors are presently developing unique ecological approaches to raise questions about the role of humans in a possible post-natural world.\nThis class is taught in English but with x-hours in Italian for majors/minors.",

Their lives will be studied through novels, essays, autobiographies, and personal letters, but also through the arts – film, music, poetry, paintings, and sculpture. Taught in Berlin as part of the JWST/GERM FSP, this course will make extensive use of the city, its memorials, physical locations of historical events, and its remarkable current population of Jewish intellectuals who will give guest talks to the class, sometimes in conjunction with the History course taught during the FSP.",

    "description": "While scholars have examined various aspects of Jewish-Christian relations, and the relations of both Christians and Jews with Muslims during the Middle Ages, the tendency has been to focus on Western Europe, or only on the Middle East and Byzantium. Yet both Jews and Christians of various kinds moved along the trade routes over land and sea throughout Asia and parts of Africa. There they traded, settled, studied, interacted with one another and other religious groups, and they invented new understandings of what it meant to be Jewish or Christian, and how these two identities might intertwine. In Asia and Africa Jews and Christians often found themselves on equal footing with one another, as minorities under Islamic, Mongol or Confucian, or Hindu rule. At other times, Jews had polities and territories of their own, for example in Khazaria or Ethiopia, with which neighboring Christian and Muslim rulers had to deal. In other instances, Jews were under Christian rule, but under Christians, for example, medieval Georgians, with a rather different history and polemical tradition than in Byzantium or the West. In this course, we will focus on Jewish-Christian relations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, West, Central, South, and East Asia, and in Africa, especially Ethiopia. Students will learn of Jewish and Christian travel and settlement in these lands, and the different expressions of Judaism and Christianity there, and forms of interaction between communities. We will also examine the imaginings, polemic, and stories that these communities developed about one another and which developed between these communities, and how these also travelled and changed with new cultural milieus, for example, how Byzantine anti-Jewish stories were transformed when they were retold in Armenia or Ethiopia. Other religious communities will be taken into account as context for these interactions, but will not be the main focus of the class.",

And how specifically are they remembered, depicted, emulated, despised or ignored since the catastrophes of the mid-twentieth Century? In this course we will examine the main events connected with the Second World War, the genocide of European Jewry and Roma-Sinti, forced resettlements of various populations, and the Allied attacks on the German civilian population.  We will analyze the different stages of coming to grips with that past on the part of German and some other postwar societies, by examining together a number of controversies like those surrounding the Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Eichmann and Barbie trials, the campaign to build a Holocaust memorial in Berlin, Neonazism, the Wehrmacht photo exhibition, and the current campaign to remember German civilian casualties and losses.  Approaching our topic with interdisciplinary and comparative methodology, that is, by utilizing history, journalism, video testimony, music, literature, and art, including film, photography and architecture, students will develop their own perspectives on the formation of postwar German identity and why Nazis remain the epitome of evil. An individual midterm project will allow students to practice the skill of summarizing different sides of a debate, and a final group project will invite students to solidify what they have learned in the course about the formation of national identity by creatively staging a contemporary debate about the Nazi past.",

Covering more than a two hundred year stretch, we will move across an expansive geography encompassing North Africa, the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Central Asia. Throughout this journey, particular attention will be paid to five important themes: imperialism, modernization, nationalism, Islam, and revolution. In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region’s dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior to exploring the impact, importance, and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the \"Arab Spring” and its aftermath. Whenever possible, we will strive to illuminate ordinary people, as opposed to only elite actors, who contributed to the making of the modern Middle East.",

This seminar builds upon these long overdue efforts by critically engaging the writings of historians, anthropologists, ethnomusicologists, and media experts with the aim of uncovering how the study of sound may radically enrich our understanding of the modern Middle East. Beginning with an overview of sound studies, we will consider where multi-sensory scholarship on North Africa, the Levant, and the Gulf fits into this burgeoning field of inquiry. After situating the Middle East within a body of literature that is at once innovative and highly interdisciplinary, we will then shift to exploring several key themes, including religion, popular culture, mass media, gender, space, and the environment, in relation to the region’s soundscapes. We will listen to audiocassette sermons in Egypt, jazz in Istanbul, and the din of warfare in Iraq, among many other acoustic items, to gain a greater appreciation for the centrality of sound in people’s everyday lives and its significance in the domain of Middle Eastern studies.",

Since colonial times Latin American and Caribbean cultures have developed against a background of cultural repression, racial conflict, political domination, colonial exploitation, and gender inequality. And yet, in the midst of all this turmoil, Latin America and the Caribbean have produced an extraordinary variety and wealth of artistic creations, ranging from literature to the visual arts, from music to film. In this course we will turn to some of the works by Latin American and Caribbean artists and writers in an attempt to illuminate and explore some of the wonders of the cultural dynamics that shape the many faces of what we call Latin America and the Caribbean.",

    "description": "In the 1960s and 1970s, South America experienced a new cycle of state violence perpetrated by military dictatorships. The authoritarian regimes installed in Brazil (1964-85), Uruguay (1973-85), Chile (1973-90) and Argentina (1976-83) caused deep ruptures in collective and individual lives and still resonate in the South American political, social and cultural landscapes. After the democratic systems were reestablished in the region, new facts about the abuse of power by the militaries were disclosed, and a heated debate took place in the public sphere about how to deal with the past. Feature films, documentaries, and fiction and non-fiction literature played an essential role in that debate by providing different strategies of healing scars, honoring victims and survivors, and preserving the memory of both the terror and the grassroots resistance. The experiences and memories of the so-called \"dirty war\" in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay generated not only several fictional renderings of state terrorism during the \"years of lead,\" but also a whole series of testimonios by those directly affected by it, such as the daughters, sons and spouses of desaparecidos who were assassinated by the machinery of state repression.\nThis class focuses on the legacies of dictatorships in South America and the politics and aesthetics of representation of state violence and political resistance. Students will be introduced to central concepts of memory and trauma studies and will conduct comparative literary and cinematic analyses of works by Latin American writers and film directors.",

While we will focus our attention on Hollywood cinema of the “golden age”, the period from the 1920s-1960, we will also spend significant time considering American independent cinema and the post-classical period of filmmaking from the 1960s to the present.

Such connections have long been recognized, but recent research from diverse fields like linguistics, (ethno)musicology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience continues to reveal just how intertwined the two faculties are. Drawing on this body of research and our respective specialties, we explore the language-music connection from the basic ingredients (pitch, timbre, rhythm, syntax), to cultural expression, to evolution and origins. Running through the course is a hands-on case study of a West African xylophone tradition where language and music are so intimately related that they cannot be separated.

The special demands of oral biography will be considered as well.\nIssues to be addressed include: the place of oral history—by nature personal and subjective—in the larger historical framework; changes demanded by a shift in medium as the oral historian transfers taped commentary to print; the role of the oral historian/oral biographer as re-caster and re-arranger of memory; evolving recording technologies and the impact of the medium on oral history’s “message” and “massage.”\nSelected oral histories (see Required Reading) will be contrasted with and compared to traditional historical accounts of similar events, as well as to one another as regards purpose, methodology, style, and literary effectiveness. Additionally students can consult historical works (see Recommended Reading) for insights into the ways in which oral history has been included. The roles and responsibilities of the practitioner as interviewer, archivist, historian, biographer, and artist will be examined and critiqued.        \nThe Course  agenda will hone students skills in interviewing, listening, transcribing, editing and organizing – moving from the spoken word to a final polished oral history work.    \nEach student will produce an oral history project comprised of 6-12 voices on a cultural, institutional, local, familial, personal, or event-based topic. Ongoing guidance will be available through one-on-one meetings  as the student goes through the process of selecting a theme and individuals to interview, preparing for and conducting interviews, transcribing and editing tapes, and fashioning from them the final work. Through discussing their projects in the Workshop component of the course, students will have the opportunity to network and benefit from feedback.\nRequirements\n\n    Timely and thorough readings of assigned works to be reflected in informed participation in class discussions. (Books must be on hand for the sessions they are to be discussed.)\n    Participation in a Collateral Readers’ Panel based on in-depth reading/viewing of a portion of a traditional historical work/documentary that deals with one or more of the subjects treated in an assigned oral history. Submission of a satisfactory Oral History Project.\n\nGrades will be based on the quality of work in all of the above. Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. \nHours\nStudents must meet with either professor a minimum of four times during scheduled Friday hours for one-on-one consultations.",

No previous creative writing experience is necessary.  Whether your idea is \"commercial,\" \"artistic,\" or \"personal\" will not matter in terms of the focus of this course, but we will be concerned with your producing something that will hold up to professional scrutiny. We will emphasize the following: 1) a comprehensible story with a beginning, middle and end 2) a sympathetic protagonist 3) a worthy antagonist 4) an appropriate \"love-interest\" (if any), 5) how to keep your story a \"page turner,\" so the reader will want to keep going; 6) proper format and length (100-120 pages) and absence of typos, 7) and originality of premise and dialogue.  Since you will be expected to write an entire first draft of a feature script within this course, it behooves you to be somewhat prepared. It would help if you have a story in mind, a protagonist, a worthy antagonist, a love-interest (if appropriate), and at least an idea of your beginning, middle and end. It also really helps to have at least 30-40 situations (scenes) to string together to support a feature-length film.

Our discussions focus on readings and films that present many different views of globalization ranging from celebration to skepticism to outright hostility.  Taking care to avoid both teleological presumptions and technological fetishism, we begin with a historical review of the economic processes most often identified as “globalization,\" and ponder the implications of research that shows globalization has a long history and that it has been reversible.  Then we spend the rest of the term critically examining the relationships between global economic integration and changes in international politics and law, as well as the emergence of diverse transnational, national, and sub-national movements opposed to the dominant ideas and practices of economic and political globalization.  These critics include human rights and environmental activists, indigenous peoples, socialists, nationalists, and fundamentalists of many different faiths.",

    "description": "Traditionally there have been just a few paths for publishing non-fiction work: short form magazine and newspaper articles, long form magazine articles (New Yorker, Vanity Fair, etc.) and book length work. In the digital age, these all still exist, but they have been joined by numerous non-print alternatives including web versions of print magazines and newspapers publishing online-only content; purely web-based platforms (Slate, Huffington Post, etc.); blogging platforms (Medium, Tumblr, Blogger, etc.) and self-published blogs.\n\nIn this course we will examine the demands, audiences, differences and pros and cons of each form of print or digital publication, with particular attention to the use of structure in all cases.\n\nThere are two main parts to writing any non-fiction narrative: assembling information and choosing how to deploy it. But the second part of this equation depends upon the format of publication and audience for which the work is intended. Each requires its own approach to structure and storytelling.\n\nWhether it’s memoir, biography, history, science or researched journalism, all non-fiction tells a story, and stories are most effective when readers find them compelling. But where does a story begin? How does it unfold? These are very important factors in building an enthralling narrative. Some successful non-fiction writers tell stories in a purely linear, chronological fashion, while start at the end or the middle or a seminal moment in between. Where to start is just the beginning - the chosen structure for telling the story runs through the entire work, which might interweave multiple topics, told from different perspectives, unfolding in different order.\n\nThese choices also depend upon the platform for publication. Traditional newspaper journalism relies heavily upon a Who/Where/What/When/Why format of immediately laying out the primary information for readers and then delving deeper into details. This comes from the basic assumption that readers have already made the choice to look for information in the particular publication. But new media is more focused on competing for the reader’s attention, and each individual article or work stands alone to a greater degree from its underlying platform, demanding that the writer seek attention through headline, topic and structure. On the other hand, book length projects lend themselves to the largest variety of options and the most elaborate structures, and ultimately succeed or fail based on the way the information is presented as much as on the information itself.\n\nThe class will examine the different outlets for non-fiction publication, print media, online media and books, and the similarities and differences between them, with a focus on the use of structure in all cases. Writing experience is nice, but the only prerequisite is interest in writing. Class time will be devoted to both student and published work, mostly student. Reading will include two full-length books demonstrating different approaches to the use and importance of structure, as well as numerous short and long form printed and online periodical articles more akin in length to the work students will produce. Assigned writings will be a series of short (2-6 page) non-fiction pieces/essays/articles in styles varying weekly, spanning multiple topics and platforms, such as memoir, history, personality profile, and event/subject profile written for print and/or online. In each case the focus will be more on the decision of how to structure the narrative to most effectively tell the story for the chosen audience and platform than on the research and topic itself. All participants will be required to read each other’s work and discuss and critique the effectiveness of the chosen structures as well as the reading assignments weekly.",

The 1970s has been defined by the “oil crisis” that had Americans lined up for gas, the “crisis of confidence” diagnosed by President Jimmy Carter, and the “crisis” of narcissism described as the “Me Decade.” Until recently the 1970s was dismissed with embarrassed references to defeat and self-indulgence. Yet it was the decade in which far-reaching and threatening economic shifts became evident and changes prompted by the political rebellions and social upheavals of the 1960s took hold in unexpected ways. The New Right sharpened the cultural critique and grassroots strategies that would yield Ronald Reagan’s major conservative victories in the 1980s and cement neoliberal governing assumptions. Left activists’ attempts to institutionalize the gains of feminism, black power, and gay liberation that would continue to provoke challenges into the 1990s, when Bill Clinton’s “third way” campaign stood as a referendum on the policies of the past. Drawing on primary sources, historical analyses, and cultural criticism, this course explores three decades of Americans’ engagement with globalization, social inequality, and cultural contestation.",

    "description": "What are the main sources of social order in an increasingly global world (dis)order? We reside at the far end of vast, rapid and complex processes of social transformation referred to as modernization. These processes include the development of new ways of organizing economies, politics, culture, and society—the fundamental building blocks of human communities. One central issue addressed in this course is the worth or legitimacy of modernity. Which of the institutions and ideas that structured and guided processes of modernization are worth defending or reforming? Which should be rejected? Or should we reject them all and instead embrace a new, post-modern political epoch? To approach these questions we will focus on the market economy, the nation state, discipline and discourse, and we will read from the giants of modern social theory: Smith, Marx and Weber, Tocqueville and Mill, Foucault and Habermas. Processes of modernization also draw more and more persons and societies into the net of interconnectiv­ity, mobility, and hybridity that we refer to as globalization. Understanding modernity as inherently global, originally imperial, and now increasingly post-colonial raises a further set of issues. Once we are attentive to the roles played by colonial domination and racial exploitation in generating modern social orders, does this fundamentally alter our verdict on these processes? What are implications of the fact that many of the tools of resistance to Western imperialism and domination seem to have been forged in the process of modernization itself? Does the Eurocentrism of the tradition of modern social theory invalidate its central concepts and insights? Or can they be reformulated in a way that divorces their critical power from the prejudices that informed their elaboration? Are ‘Europeans’ increasingly ‘provincialized’ as Western political, social and epistemic hegemony declines in an ever-more global world? This course tackles these issues in tandem. It pairs some of the most important modern social theorists with some of their most trenchant global and post-colonial critics, exploring several dimensions of the interchange between ‘the West and the rest’ and in the process throwing into sharp focus the question of the legitimacy of global modernity.",

    "description": "Globalization has eroded local traditions, economies, and sources of authority. Yet, in in spite of – or perhaps because of this – the local has retained both its allure and potency as a discourse of social, cultural, and political resistance to globalization. Adages such as “all politics is local” and “think globally, act locally” reflect commonly touted assumptions of the enduring significance of the local.\nThis course draws on theoretical texts, documentary film, history, and cultural studies to analyze articulations of the local in a range of responses to globalization. Early readings will establish the contours of globalization and prompt students to pose broad questions about what theorists call the “production of locality.” We’ll explore these questions with close readings around four themes, including media, civil society, food, and labor. We’ll read work by Antonio Negri, David Harvey, and Saskia Sassen, among others. Topics covered will range from the 1994 Zapatista uprising in Mexico and its influence on other resistance movements to expressions of “gastronationalism” and the politics of local food consumption.\nStudents will write a brief 5-page essay responding to the readings, a 7-10 page review essay, and a 12-15-page research paper, on which they’ll base a class presentation.

    "description": "Narratives about the emergence of European modernity often link the rise of the modern nation state and the triumph of Enlightenment rationality with the decline of religion in a process of secularization. With an increasing separation of religion and politics, the story goes, religion is relegated to the private sphere while a civic politics occupies the public sphere. A globalized world characterized by networks of communication and cultural exchange might appear, then, as the epitome of a cosmopolitan capitalism and its secular ethos. \nIn the last two decades, however, this narrative of secularization has been called into question in the midst of a “return of religion” in a “post-secular society.” Scholarship on political theology, meanwhile, has shown how modern politics and its concept of sovereign power adopt and appropriate religious forms of thought in their secular institutions. Instead of secularization as the decline of religion, critics are rethinking secularization in terms of a hidden afterlife of religion in a secular modernity that is unable to cast aside its theological roots.\nThe course will examine how the return of religion and political theology are transforming politics in a globalized and post-national European modernity. In what ways might religion undergird the call for a “radical Enlightenment” that exceeds national boundaries? How might a post-secular society entertain a dialogue of religion and the secular through mutual translation? How might religion provide a basis not only for the theory of sovereign power but for forms of resistance in which the public sphere is contested? \nWe will tackle these questions through readings of classical texts (Luther, Hobbes, Spinoza, Kant, Schmitt) alongside the work of twentieth-century and contemporary German, French, and Anglo-American critics (de Vries, Casanova, Hardt and Negri, Arendt, Lefort, Foucault, Said, Löwith, Blumenberg, Habermas, Taylor, Asad).",

Thus, it will critically address and theorize the more recent tendency to shift and cross normative borders in a way that runs counter to the constraints implied in traditional models of gender and race. In terms of gender, it will emphasize the contemporary fluidity of concepts of masculinity and femininity, deconstruction of hierarchical gender models, as well as the growing debate around transgender issues in texts, among others, by Judith Butler. In terms of race, it will address the paradigm’s contested definitions and boundaries, and the current debate on its social implications.

    "description": "Was the US born capitalist? If so when, how, and with what consequences in global political economy and the world? How have changes in production and labor processes across time relied upon and re-shaped US law and political struggles under it? Has there always been and will there always be an “inside” and an “outside” to economic gains and the American legal system? Where are we now and how are we related to past configurations of capitalism, labor, and the law? With attention to political economy and the law, this course takes a historical approach to development, state-formation, power, and labor and employment relations in the United States. In so doing, we trace the global origins and global present of American capitalism and follow the struggles waged by citizens, servants, slaves, unions, migrants, and workers laboring extra-territorially for US interests in American law. We will not only read secondary texts, but key legal decisions addressing the topics listed above.",

    "description": "The prison has become a central institution of American society; more than two million people are currently held in federal prisons, state prisons, juvenile correctional facilities, local jails, military prisons, and detention facilities at home and in US territories abroad. In fact, US incarceration rates are the highest worldwide. Whereas in the 19th century the American prison was often considered a ‘modern’ institution of reform (replacing corporal punishment) which was visited and inspected by European visitors such as Alexis de Tocqueville and Charles Dickens, it has become the object of grave humanitarian concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries. Terms such as “carceral state” and “prison industrial complex” (referring to profit-oriented multinational corporations in the prison sector) figure prominently in recent critical interventions. We will briefly review the history of the US prison system in the first part of the seminar.\nFor those on the outside, the prison population is often rendered invisible and voiceless. And yet, from its beginnings, American literary and cultural production abounds with experiences of captivity, bondage, and imprisonment. H. Bruce Franklin, for instance, has remarked on the African American literary tradition as being rooted in the experience of imprisonment and slavery, and obviously race and racialization continue to be crucial aspects in view of a prison population that is largely non-white. Of course, other markers of difference such as gender, class, religion, and sexual orientation also have to be taken into account. In response to the dramatic increase in imprisonment rates over the last decades, prison abolitionism has formed and become a major social and political movement to protest mass incarceration as the “New Jim Crow” (Michelle Alexander, Angela Davis). In the second part of this seminar we will focus on prison writing in various forms (including texts, films, and television series) and on the theoretical approaches that have emerged in the field of critical prison studies to adequately address the nexus of violence, (state) power, and punishment.\nRequired reading includes texts by Michel Foucault, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., Leonard Peltier, Hisaye Yamamoto as well as Angela Davis, Are Prisons Obsolete?(2003), Stewart O’Nan, The Good Wife (2005), and Piper Kerman, Orange is the New Black (2015).

    "description": "In 2000, political philosophers Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri published “Empire,” a work that argued that we have moved from imperialism to Empire, defined as a shift from sovereign to networked rule, from British to American world dominance. If imperialism was a juridical construction extending from the metropole to the colony; Empire, Hardt and Negri argued, is characterized by the boundary-less power of law.\nThis course on “Empire and Law” is about studying and assessing Hardt and Negri’s history and claims. In so doing, we examine what legal anthropologists have labeled the passage of law and colonialism to that of law and globalization, with a focus upon the British Empire and American power at the close of the twentieth-century. By concentrating upon law and colonialism and law and globalization as fields structuring the global economy since the 19th century, moreover, this course emphasizes and compares the manifold constitutive powers of law in economy and society as well as how scholars in both fields have approached its study. How did law shape colonial empire and what is the role of law under globalization? Did Hardt and Negri fully characterize or over-state the differences in legal rule across empires? Have events since 2000, such as 9/11, the Iraq War, and the election of Donald Trump re-configured Empire and its laws?",

Cultural Studies has been described as the academic location where the politics of difference -- racial, sexual, economic, transnational -- can combine and be articulated in all of their theoretical complexity. It has also been depicted as an academic containment strategy designed to tame cultural otherness through the universalization of the \"idea\" of culture and the resistance to theory. In this course we shall analyze the work of scholars -- bell hooks, Douglas Crimp, Janice Radway, Paul Gilroy, Stuart Hall, Homi Bhabha, Andrew Ross, Meaghan Morris, Elsbeth Probyn, Michael Warner, Rey Chow, Cornel west, Kobena Mercer, Judith Butler, among others -- who explicitly reflect upon the importance of conceptualizing and defining this diverse and often contentious enterprise. In addition to examining the social and institutional geneology of the field, we shall deploy disparate methodological practices developed within the field of Cultural Studies to analyze a range of cultural artifices including: film noir, television soap operas, rap music, Hollywood blockbusters, borderlands discourse, whiteness studies and postcolonial theory.",

    "description": "Globalization and the pursuit of market-led development have become two crucial concepts that re-emerged full-blown in the wake of the Cold War, as the West triumphed over the Soviet Union and the Marxist model.    With the United States as the sole remaining super power, liberal democracy and market-led economies were widely considered by policy makers in the West to be the inevitable cornerstone of a new global order.   Yet, the process of globalization since the early 1990s has produced unpredicted results.    The end of the Cold War has not generated a prolonged \"Pax Americana\" marked by an end to intra-state warfare, insurgencies, or violence, nor has economic development resulted in the consolidation of democracy.  The strongest economic performer in the post Cold War period has been China, still an authoritarian Marxist regime, and the Russian Federation that emerged from the former USSR is evolving in a decidedly anti-democratic direction. \nThe end of the Cold War in the Americas appeared to usher in the potential for greater hemispheric unity, the strengthening of representative democracy and sustained economic growth.  While economic development has been historically strong, it remains uneven and the fruits of economic success often distributed in a skewed pattern favoring elite groups.    In several countries in the region, a strong reaction to liberal democracy and market-led economic growth gave rise to the consolidation of proto-authoritarian regimes such as that of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela promoting a 21st century brand of revolution and a revival of anti-U.S. sentiment. Countries in the region still contend with problems such as insurgency, organized crime, and high levels of violence.  \nThis course will examine the links between democracy, market-led development, and globalization in greater theoretical depth as well as in practice since the end of the Cold War.  It will use Latin America as a particular point of focus in highlighting macro trends in politics and economic policy-making since the 1990s as well as case studies digging deeper into these variables.\nThe first part of the course focuses on globalization in general, its impact on the world economy and the economies of specific countries and on international business.  The tension between globalization and moral questions will be elaborated on.  Intellectual/ideological responses to globalization will also be discussed.\nThe second part of the course will trace trends in Latin America's links to the global economy and the relationship between paths of economic development and political structures.  Specific attention will be paid to the transition from military dictatorships to civilian democracies, the challenge of illegally armed groups and criminal organizations to stability in the region, and the current bifurcated development path between countries pursuing market-oriented growth policies and those engaged in inward-led growth and resource nationalism.",

Originating in the Hebrew Bible as prophesy of the Jewish “dispersion in all kingdoms of the earth,” contemporary uses of the term have accrued meaning in a variety of contexts and disciplines to designate \"the movement, migration, or scattering of people away from an established or ancestral homeland.” Considering mass-migration, exile, and expulsion in all sectors of the world, this seminar will focus on a variety of concepts and theories related to diaspora. Studying a range of ethnographic, historical, theoretical, and literary texts, we will compare Jewish, African, and Asian diasporas in the context of historical, cultural and territorial characteristics. We will also discuss questions such as “the power of diaspora” vs. homeland, the role of the nation state vs. transnational or post-national aspects of culture, cultural identity, and hybridity.",

    "description": "This course provides students the opportunity to study, discuss, and write about global media and the transformation of cultures and relations between peoples since the 1980s. Although most historians argue that globalization is an old process that began with the establishment of inter-regional trade many centuries ago, they also agree with other social scientists who see this most recent phase of globalization as qualitatively different from earlier stages of the process.  Indeed it seems fair to say that what most people today mean when they use the word “globalization” would not exist without the new global media.   \n\nPerhaps the most important features of recent globalization are the continuous development of new media (especially the internet and social media) and the rapid global diffusion of those media.   In this course students will study these subjects and how they are involved in ongoing changes in everyday life, social relations, high and popular cultures, and the practice of politics all around the world.  Seminar meetings for most of the term will consist primarily of discussion of readings, films, and videos assigned to all students, and at the end of the term discussion the particular research projects done by each student. \n\nSEMINAR REQUIREMENTS\nThis is not a lecture course.  To be successful, all members of the seminar have to participate in discussions of course materials.  Students are required to finish assigned readings and videos as preparation for in-class discussions.  Readings include several required books, as well as articles that are available online. Videos include documentary and feature films on reserve at the Jones Media Center.  Participation in the seminar’s discussions will count for 25% of the final grade.\n\nStudents will be required to write a series of three related papers focused on global media in a particular country.  Students with good second language skills are encouraged to select a country in which English is not the native tongue.  Having each student focus the independent component of their work in the course on media developments and culture in a particular country will enable the whole seminar to construct a unique global understanding of our subject that is grounded in many details drawn from many parts of the world by the students.  Each student will report first on media development in the country they have chosen in a short factual report.  Their second paper will describe and discuss the ways media in their particular country have covered a global news story of importance (ie. the election of Donald Trump).  The student’s final paper on their particular country will present research on a narrowly defined media subject of special interest to them.",

These hidden and irresponsible social behaviors have always contributed to the building of visible and invisible social walls. Behind these walls, a growing invisible population has found a way to social visibility through addiction, violence, and crime. This course offers students the unique opportunity to collaborate with a group of people from behind those social walls from two distinct perspectives: theoretical and practical. For one class each week, students will study the root causes of social isolation and invisibility mainly pertaining to incarceration and addiction, in an active learning classroom. For the other half, students will travel to Sullivan County Department of Corrections, in Unity, NH and participate in an interdisciplinary arts program for inmates there. Its final goal is the creation and performance of an original production on the theme of the inmates’ voices. The final project for the course will combine research on themes related to incarceration, rehabilitation, transition, facilitation with critical analysis and self-reflection on the effectiveness of community-based learning and performance in rehabilitation.",

    "description": "In 1948, the UN drafted its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In it, Article 25 states  that “Everyone has the right to...food...and medical care.” But today almost 800 million people globally – one in about 8 human beings -- remain trapped in extreme hunger and poverty. Despite major strides during the past decade, hunger and poverty remain with us. This course will detail the plight of the so-called “bottom billion” people who are living on less than US$1.25 a day. But it will also examine a second billion, who face chronic hunger and disease in both developing and developed countries. In the United States, for example, some 45 million people – about one in 7 Americans – suffer “chronic food insecurity”. More than half of them are children; 8 percent are elderly.\nDespite the good intentions of the Universal Declaration and the more recent Millennium Goals, we have failed to achieve “health and well-being . . . including food, clothing, housing and medical care . . . .” for the world’s people. The Declaration remains today a promise diluted, its basic premise and hope unfulfilled. As its core catalytic question, therefore, this course asks: Why?\nThe instructors and students will use didactic presentations, case study methodology, briefing papers and other analytical tools to interrogate two broad components:\n• The first will define and analyze the hunger, health and poverty problems, and the efforts to resolve them. We will present, discuss and use the major documents (U.N., U.S. Census, etc) along with the theories of Thomas Malthus and Amartya Sen. The course will engage the training of its two instructors and juxtapose the social science of poverty and hunger with the biology of chronic undernutrition and the subsequent increased susceptibility to otherwise preventable or treatable infectious diseases responsible for most of the preventable health problems and deaths among the bottom two billion people.\n• The course’s second component will focus on workable solutions. If poverty is the cause of chronic hunger and poor health, how might this be resolved? Were the Millennium Goals focused on the wrong solutions? What is working and what is not?\nDr.  Jim Yung Kim, until recently head of Dartmouth College and now the 12th president of the World Bank, has often said that the response to hunger, poverty and lack of health care will define “the moral standing” of his generation. This course will focus on the defining edge of that moral response, and participants will be expected to identify and address its details.",

    "description": "Early modern philosophical regimes of knowledge in Europe tend to revolve around two major senses: that of sight, and that of touch. For seventeenth-century French philosopher, René Descartes, for example, perception relies on the ability of the human eye to serve as a direct link between the exterior world and the interior subject (the soul). The desire to understand the ways in which the body perceives the senses and translates them into a basis for memory and knowledge is evident in the art, philosophy, and literature of the day. In this course, we will analyze works of art, literature, and philosophy from the 16th-18th centuries in England, France, Italy, and Germany, asking how aesthetic and materialist theories that emerge and take hold in the early modern period still shape modern understandings of the human and its relation to the world.\nExploring aesthetic reactions and writings on art and literature, we will investigate the idea of sensibility, perception and the senses, visual knowledge, and modes of feeling and knowing through sight and touch.

Aristotle called this human capacity phronesis and saw it as essential for doing the right thing in the right way at the right time. Throughout the course, we will be investigating five questions:\n\n    What is practical wisdom?\n    When and why do we need it?\n    How do we learn practical wisdom?\n    What institutional forces threaten practical wisdom?\n    How can institutions be designed to encourage and nurture practical wisdom?\n\nWe will investigate these questions in several important domains in life - friendship, education, work, medicine, and family. Because practical wisdom is learned by reflecting on our own practices and experiences, we will rely heavily on stories about your own experiences that you will write and present in light of the theory and cases we read. Improving our own skills in reflective practice will also be encouraged by the format of the class which will rely on well-informed and thoughtful discussion in a seminar format.\nWe will also investigate these questions more theoretically in an effort to develop a solid understanding of what makes wisdom or judgment a crucial component of our lives. Throughout the course, we will be contrasting decision-making that depends on practical wisdom with decision making that depends on following various kind of rules or responding to external rewards and punishments.\nThis will be an interdisciplinary course with readings drawn from philosophy, ethics, literature, psychology, education, and sociology.

This seminar builds upon these long overdue efforts by critically engaging the writings of historians, anthropologists, ethnomusicologists, and media experts with the aim of uncovering how the study of sound may radically enrich our understanding of the modern Middle East. Beginning with an overview of sound studies, we will consider where multi-sensory scholarship on North Africa, the Levant, and the Gulf fits into this burgeoning field of inquiry. After situating the Middle East within a body of literature that is at once innovative and highly interdisciplinary, we will then shift to exploring several key themes, including religion, popular culture, mass media, gender, space, and the environment, in relation to the region’s soundscapes. We will listen to audiocassette sermons in Egypt, jazz in Istanbul, and the din of warfare in Iraq, among many other acoustic items, to gain a greater appreciation for the centrality of sound in people’s everyday lives and its significance in the domain of Middle Eastern studies.",

In this course, we will examine the politics of Iraq under the British mandate, as an independent state under the monarchy, and as a republic after the coup of 1958. We will also examine the rule of the Baath and of Saddam Hussein as well as the American invasion of Iraq and its aftermath. Drawing on a mixture of texts and media, the course explores the prevalent tropes of Iraqi culture, the ideologies underpinning these tropes and in doing so provides a cultural context for understanding the forces that shaped the modern history of that country.",

This struggle transformed the political, economic, social and cultural landscape of the country, and continues to be the focal point of its unfolding drama. The spread of modern ideologies (nationalism, liberalism, socialism), the construction of Islamism, the reordering of social hierarchies and family structure, the transformation of norms and values, among other issues, are better understood when read as part of this long, twisted, and tormented march of modernity.",

This course introduces students to various aspects of this role and the reactions it triggered. It covers the role played by American missionaries and travelers/immigrants around the turn of the 20th century. It analyzes the transformative impact of the discovery of Oil, the establishment of the state of Israel, the Cold War, Turkey’s integration into NATO and the US attempts to establish a security regime for the Middle East. It also examines how Americans viewed the Middle East and their role in its life. In addition, the course then takes the students in a tour d’horizon of US role in Middle East politics: its involvement in the Arab-Israeli Peace Process, its responses to Radical Islamism and 9/11, the invasion of Iraq and its consequences, the uneasy relationship with a changing Turkey, and its policy of “democracy promotion”. It discusses the doctrines defining US role in the region since Truman until Obama’s “disengagement”. Combining academic books with novels and movies, this course should give students a rounded view of the role and lasting impact of the United States in one of the world’s most turbulent regions.",

Dictatorship is usually described as a strongman imposing his will on the nation through sheer force. French political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie (1530–1563) in his seminal essay Discours de la servitude volontaire (Discourse on Voluntary Servitude) presented the existence of a dictatorship as a relationship between two parties. Before every dictator is a population that is willing to accept rule by the dictator. The dictator cannot impose his will on a people that shun a dictatorship. Extrapolating from this concept, we can consider dictatorship to be a syndrome. The dictionary defines a syndrome as “a group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality or condition.” In this course, students will examine the condition, signs, symptoms, and cures for the malady of dictatorship.",

We will test these theories by applying them to specific cases. A major part of the course will focus on the economic 'miracle' of East Asian countries, as well as cases that have not been so successful.

But if articulations of love “translate” unspeakable thoughts and desires in the first place, what happens to these articulations when they are re-translated and move across cultures? What’s gained and lost in the process? These translations can be seen as crucibles for cultural encounter and models for self-other relations and gender identity. How have translations challenged (or perpetuated) hegemonic ideas about sexual morality, stylistic propriety, the religious and the profane? How have they been generative in the target literatures and why? We will examine key intersections of love and translation, compare and contrast old and new translations, and become acquainted with key problems in translation theory.",

Although this course cannot be comprehensive in its survey of either Jewish or African literatures, it will offer suggestive juxtapositions of the two to emphasize commonalities between their historical and political experience.

    "description": "The complex identities of Jews and Arabs alike are affected by religion, culture, language, history, and politics, all in their own terms and with the fault lines running both between and within the two communities. Despite their internal and mutual conflicts, the two groups share similar experiences of hostility when trying to integrate into American society with fierce antisemitism and Islamophobia against the backdrop of increasing right-wing ethno-nationalism. Concomitantly, both groups share deep ambivalences about assimilating to American culture vs. retaining discrete cultural identities. If Jews and Arabs play decisive roles in US politics, both as effective actors and as imagined targets of opposition, the United States in turn acted not only as mediator in the international relationship between the two groups; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, post-9/11 politics, anti-terrorist actions, or the Trump administration’s travel ban on five Muslim-dominated countries have also influenced the relationship between Jewish and Arab communities within the United States. Instead of equating the experiences of Jews and Arabs viz-a-viz America, this course examines the multifaceted encounters in what has to be considered a complex Jewish-Arab-American triangular. The ways in which Jews and Arabs interact in the US, will be as central to the course as examples of hybrid cultural experiences of Arab Jews and artefacts such as the numerous American synagogues built in the style of Moorish architecture. We will examine cultural representations of Jews and Arabs in American literature, movies, documentaries, memoirs, art, popular culture and political analyses with attention to aspects of class, race and gender. Finally, the course will focus on the political expressions of Jewish- and Arab-Americans and their relations to the Middle East, and here in particular to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",

Through close readings of both primary sources (in translation) and secondary literature — including historiographical, theoretical, and literary texts as well as film and music— we will also tackle the questions, controversies, and stereotypes that have animated debates in both scholarly and popular literature on such topics as the veil, feminism, revolution, human rights, LGBT issues, masculinity, and war.",

Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the “Arab Spring” and its aftermath.

Are Arabs condemned to live under tyranny or is there hope for those who seek democratic, accountable governments and rule of law?  \nTo answer this question, we will dig into the complex political and cultural realities of the Arab World. We will read about old and new Arab revolutions; from Prince Abdul-­‐Qader’s armed revolt in Algeria (1832-­‐1847); Egypt’s multiple revolutions \n(1882 and 1919); Lawrence of Arabia’s Arab revolt (1914-­‐1918); the bleak revolution of Palestine (1936), all the way to the Arab Spring of 2011 and its subsequent collapse into civil war and despotism. The readings cover these revolutions and the deep dynamics that shape Arab societies and states. As such, this course introduces students to the politics and culture of one of the most turbulent regions of our world.",

    "description": "This course provides practical training experience through a full-time internship at an institution outside of the Dartmouth College campuses (Lebanon and Hanover). The goal of this course is to provide students with real-world, hands-on experience with existing enterprises through internship during graduate school. Such experience will expose students to diverse career opportunities during graduate school, providing students with lead-time to focus and network in a field of interest prior to completion of their PhD. Multiple types of training (e.g., project management and business entrepreneurship skills needed in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, teaching experience needed for a successful faculty position in liberal arts colleges) will be particularly valuable for students who go on to conduct NIH-funded research as well as benefit those students who do not follow the academic research career track. Approximately 30% of biomedical PhDs work in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries in research and non-research positions.\n \nExamples of potential internship opportunities are:\n\n    Researcher in a biotechnology or pharmaceutical company\n    Business and marketing associate in a biotechnology or pharmaceutical company\n    Teacher/lecturer at an institution of higher education/college\n    Assistant at a patent law firm\n    Position in office of government policy and legislation\n    Position in office of public health policy\n\n   For this course, the student will propose and arrange a paid or unpaid internship in an existing enterprise (industry, government, or other) in consultation with their Thesis Advisor (primary mentor), Advisory Committee, and MCB Graduate Committee prior to enrollment.  This process should happen in advance of the term of enrollment. Course enrollment is concurrent with the internship and should be for a period of one term. At the end of the internship, the student will make an oral presentation (with Powerpoint slides; approx. 20 minutes) to the MCB community that addresses the nature of the enterprise they were engaged in, the problem they were assigned, and the results and impact of their project. The purpose of the presentation is to share lessons learned from the internship experience with the MCB community. The presentation will be accompanied by a short but complete written report. Neither the presentation nor report should contain confidential information of the enterprise.\n   The Internship Proposal Form  must be completed prior to committing to an internship, and must be signed by the student’s Thesis Advisor and the Course Director. A letter from the Internship Supervisor at the proposed host enterprise must be sent to the Thesis Advisor and Course Director detailing the start/end dates of the internship, and the job function and roles of the intern.\nPrerequisite: Must have completed all MCB Program and course requirements prior to enrolling.  Senior students in their fourth year or beyond who are still conducting their research and are at least 6 months away from thesis defense will be eligible.  Must have prior approval of Thesis Advisor, Advisory Committee and MCB Graduate Committee for internship.  \nThis course is graded on a credit/no credit basis by the Course Director after completion of the written report and oral presentation. International students with visa sponsorship should consult with the Office of Visa and Immigration Services (OVIS) regarding eligibility, and review the appended information on F-1 Curricular Practical Training.\nFinancial matters:\n   The internship may be paid or unpaid by the host enterprise or by Dartmouth stipend, depending on arrangement with their Thesis Advisor (as in cases where the internship is a collaboration that will benefit the Advisor’s research), but the total student/intern salary cannot exceed the amount that student would have otherwise received as Dartmouth stipend. Internship at another academic institution to perform research is discouraged; the goal of this internship program is to expose students to career environments not found within Dartmouth. The Thesis Advisor cannot serve as or appoint the Internship Supervisor (such as in cases where the proposed internship would be hosted by a local company in which the Thesis Advisor has a stake/role).\n   Dartmouth-based health insurance benefits will be paid by the student’s Thesis Advisor for the term.",

How have African musicians negotiated independence, democratization, and postcoloniality through their musical expressions? How have they used music to forge links with Africans in other nations and a broader African diaspora? And how have African popular musics, and the musicians themselves, circulated in local and global contexts? In this course, we investigate a range of popular musics from the African continent, focusing in particular on music from Western and Southern Africa. Students will be introduced to diverse genres, from highlife to chimurenga to kwaito, and the methodological approaches of ethnomusicology. Each case study fits into four broad course themes: music and political dissent; music and diaspora; African music and the “World Music” industry; music and youth culture. Texts, performances, media, and in-class workshops all form an integral part of this course.",

This course examines the pervasive appearance of the seductive, strange, and evolving Indian figure in works by prominent American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, James Fenimore Cooper, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Willa Cather, and Toni Morrison. We will explore the shifting and ideological role of the Indian as tragic emblem, savage defender, spiritual ally, and modern foil. We will explore the complicated ways that the literary Indian has served to both authenticate and trouble the nation's founding narratives and desires, and more recently, to stand as a mythical antidote to postmodern crises of value, economics, ecology, and spirituality. We will consider the appeal of such tropes in particular regional and historical contexts, such as the Reconstruction South, as well as racial or ethnic ones, such as the African American appropriation of Indian resistance, nobility, and genealogies.",

    "description": "Since John F. Kennedy’s 1961 executive order to implement affirmative action policies, institutions of higher education have looked for ways to encourage minority and low-income students to matriculate. Some institutions, such as such as Harvard, UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and UMichigan, have experienced lawsuits against the policy’s implementation. As universities stress their desire for diverse, well-rounded, high achieving classes and continue to implement methods to attract highly qualified students, there is disagreement about which methods are both effective and fair. How can educational administrators, parents and community members work together to improve college access and increase equality? Do we still need to “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are…treated…without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\" or has affirmative action outlived its original purpose? Has the college access gap widened or shrunk? Are students’ experiences on campus living up to the goal of equal opportunity? This course will explore the topic of affirmative action through some traditional classroom techniques (reading/ writing/ discussion) as well as experiential education techniques (such as creating a public policy portfolio project, having conversations with professionals who administer affirmative action at colleges and universities, and pitching proposals to a panel of policy experts).\n\\fThe central work of the course involves creating a portfolio of venues to explore, design, publicize, and promote an affirmative action or anti-discrimination policy/program. Completing the course readings and discussions will develop the skills necessary to complete the portfolio. Throughout the course, students will work in small groups to develop a policy campaign using techniques from writing to video to speeches. This course design attempts to raise students’ awareness of the multiple communication modes for making a compelling and persuasive policy proposal. To create their portfolios, students must advance an issue, demonstrate the techniques they have used to study and develop it, and effectively persuade their audience of the policy/program’s value.

Working effectively in public health and health care depends on our ability to manage conflict effectively, learn how to understand others’ perspectives and interests, and give and receive feedback. If poorly managed or avoided, conflict reduces productivity, undermines trust and leads to worse outcomes. If viewed as an opportunity to explore the concerns and different perspectives that others may have, working through these differences can enable individuals and teams to come up with better solutions and work more effectively. Students will learn the basic principles and skills of how to engage effectively with differences and conflicts, understand the strengths and weaknesses of how you tend to approach conflict in your life, and provide you a framework for thinking about both communication and negotiation.\n1 credit; (CT, NC)\n Required for Online MPH",

It encapsulates the break from prior Scholastic and Renaissance traditions in philosophy and science and becomes hugely influential in setting the agenda of western philosophy—in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, ethics, political philosophy, etc.—through the 20th century and up to today.",

This position found its most detailed presentation in John Locke (1632-1704), George Berkeley (1685-1753), and David Hume (1711-1776). It led to a picture of the mind, how it relates to the world, and how this leads to knowledge that is still influential today. This course develops that picture, with an eye to the philosophical context in which it came about and its influence on subsequent generations. In addition to Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, other (mainly British) writers considered might include Thomas Hobbes, Margaret Cavendish, Anne Conway, Catharine Cockburn, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Damaris Masham, Frances Hutcheson, Thomas Reid, and Mary Shepard.",

The nature of the cosmos: from a closed cosmos to an expanding universe and the multiverse; 2. The nature of matter: from alchemy to quarks and quantum physics; 3. The nature of mind: Godel's incompleteness theorem, mathematics, computers, and the problem of consciousness. The main text will be The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning, by Marcelo Gleiser (Basic Books, Spring 2014).

We formulate our life goals in terms of emotions, striving to obtain happiness, while avoiding regret. Emotions such as love, pride, contempt, and shame shape our social relationships, both as individuals and as groups. When our emotions go badly awry, we suffer debilitating mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Although emotions play a central role in our lives, studying them scientifically presents profound challenges. They seem intuitively hidden, elusive, messy, and hard to evoke or quantify in a laboratory. Despite these challenges, researchers have developed a thriving science of our emotional lives, which you will learn about in this course. We will begin by considering the origins of emotion, both biological and cultural. Subsequently we will examine how emotions manifest themselves in our bodies and brains, change dynamically over time, shape our social interactions, influence our cognition, and affect our mental health. Finally, we will consider ongoing theoretical debates in emotion science, and where the field could and should go next.",

    "description": "In our daily lives we are faced with many decisions: what to eat for lunch, whether to spend the next hour on Instagram or on homework, or what courses to take next quarter. Some of those decisions require gradual deliberation while others can be made quickly. Nevertheless, to make any decision we rely on external information and what outcomes we expect from those decisions. Decisions are easy to make if information is complete and the outcomes are certain. But how does the brain combine different sources of partial information to make decisions in the face of uncertain outcomes?  In this course we will examine decision making from both behavioral and neurobiological points of view. Specifically, we will learn about different methods used in psychology, economics, and neuroscience (e.g. operant conditioning, game theory, reinforcement learning, prospect theory, electrophysiology, neuroimaging) to study decision making at various levels, from cognitive processes to underpinning neural activity and mechanisms.",

This course will introduce conceptual frameworks to understand reward as a phenomenon that is distinct from other features of goal-directed behavior. We will then discuss recent advances in neuroscience research that are helping us to understand the basic brain mechanisms that make things pleasurable, including anatomical pathways, neurotransmitter systems, and dynamics of neural activity.",

We also examine how recent neurobiological discoveries are used to refine decision theories and models developed in psychology and economics. During this course, students will read and discuss the most current research findings in neuroeconomics. They will also learn to develop new ideas/hypotheses and design experiments to test those ideas/hypotheses, or to use their knowledge to inform society about the implications of findings in the field of neuroeconomics.",

This course will explore the hypothesis that all these modes of human behavior and cognition share a common root cause in our brains. We will focus in particular on the human capacity to imagine. We can, for example, construct a representation of a thing, say an airplane, or an event, say a planned party, and then go about making real that which we imagined. How is this capacity to imagine and creatively plan realized in the brain? Where did it first appear in the human lineage? What is the relationship of imagining to other important capacities, such as attention, volition, consciousness, planning and executive control? The goal of this course is to try to answer such questions by reading empirical and theoretical papers and chapters that try to account for what it is that makes the human mind human, by looking at distinctive aspects of processing in the human brain.",

We will at the same time examine what is known about the neural bases of visual consciousness, with a particular focus on those aspects of neural processing that are modulated by volitionally attending to a stimulus or not.

This course will address this question, which is known as ‘the problem of other minds.’ We will tackle ‘the problem of other minds’ from multiple angles, relying heavily on neuroscience and psychology research, as well as a few foundational papers from philosophy. Specifically, we will address questions such as: Do specialized portions of the brain accomplish mental state inference? When do mind-reading skills develop in children and are humans the only species that can represent other minds? Why do some people, such as individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), experience difficulties in understanding others? What leads to biases in mental state inference, such as anthropomorphism  (when people attribute mental states to inanimate objects) and dehumanization (when people under attribute mental states to humans)?",

    "description": "Digitization of vast numbers of texts and rapid advances in computational methods are enabling new forms of criticism in all areas of literary study. Classics was an early adopter of digital technologies, and computation is now pervasive throughout the field, as illustrated by flagship projects such as the Perseus Digital Library. Beyond the familiar examples of digitized texts and simple word searches, scholars and students also benefit from an ever-growing array of sophisticated quantitative tools, and from increasing engagement with diverse technical disciplines – natural language processing, data science, even bioinformatics. Through a survey of recent research at the intersection of Latin literature and the digital humanities, this course will introduce you to the state of the art in quantitative literary criticism. To ground our methodological investigations, we will explore a diverse selection of Latin poetry, including epic (Vergil, Lucan, and Catullus), elegy (Catullus), and comedy (Plautus), and sample some less famous later authors, such as Paul the Deacon and Vitalis of Blois, who were influenced by classical antecedents. At each turn, we will examine the interplay between traditional (close reading, philology, theory) and data-driven analyses of Latin literature and consider how quantitative methods can support humanistic inquiry. Along the way, you will gain hands-on experience with powerful computational tools and be introduced to now ubiquitous critical approaches, such as intertextuality and reception studies. Assigned readings will be in English translation using bilingual Latin-English editions; in addition to reading all of the English, students with Latin will be responsible for understanding and translating “micro samples” of the original texts. The course assumes no prior computational background.",

You likely have learned how to answer questions like these with standard OLS (linear) regression techniques and cross-sectional data, which remain useful tools in social scientists’ methodological toolbox. But these techniques are also quite limited, and impose strict assumptions that do not allow us to meet many of our goals, adequately answer our questions, or provide stringent tests of our theories and hypotheses.\n\\fIn this course, we’ll pick up where introductory statistics courses leave off, and get an introduction to more advanced statistical methods for observational data, including but not limited to: regression for categorical dependent variables, fixed and random effects models, and hierarchical linear modeling. This course will be a mix of seminar and lecture, where we will be focused on understanding how we can use these methods to better meet our goals and answer our research questions. Put differently, this course is less focused on going “under the hood” and more focused on “how to drive”—specifically, we will interrogate the assumptions and use of these statistical methods in the social sciences and learn how to implement these methods using STATA. This will include: discussion of core methodological assumptions and limitations, how to apply these statistical methods in different settings, and learning when specific methods are appropriate tools and when they are not. We will explore these issues through student-led discussions, hands-on data analysis, and dissecting the application of these methods in academic journal articles. As part of this course, you will be exposed to (and critique) a wide range of sociological research published in our major disciplinary journals. The course will culminate in an independent research project where students will analyze data and use the one or more of the modeling techniques discussed during the term to answer a sociological research question of their choosing.

Religion is understood to direct the individual to the contemplation of the divine and provide a moral code; sex and sexuality is often perceived as too human and too tied to pleasure to have anything to do with the divine. But if we examine the relationship between sexuality and religion, we find that the two are inextricably intertwined. Indeed, the understanding of humans as sexed beings (that is, with differing sexual identities and as beings who engage in sex) is often grounded in religious texts, practices, and ideologies. Yet that religious grounding, while seemingly so solid, proves surprisingly flexible in practice. We will examine comparatively the ways in which religious stories, beliefs, and practices have shaped across several traditions. In addition to studying the normative ways that religions constructed sex and sexuality, we also examine how communities and individuals have re-interpreted, re-shaped, and refused the boundaries of normative religion.",

Why is the problem of technology seemingly central to the question of modernity, and how does religion fit in, if at all?

Agriculture enabled the development of complex civilizations which had a tendency to press ecological support systems to the point of collapse. The latest of these – industrial capitalism – is now a global civilization and is putting pressure on the planet as a whole to the extent that the evolving and reparative capacities of life on earth are at risk. Despite a groundswell of environmental protest, and regulatory changes, mainstream conservation and climate science has not yet changed the direction of civilization in a more sustainable direction. Some in the conservation movement have joined forces with religious leaders such as Patriarch Bartholomew, and Pope Francis who penned an ‘environmental encyclical’ in 2015, in recognition of the enduring cultural power of religion and of its potential to promote pro-environmental beliefs and behaviors. In this course we will study the book which inspired the formation of the EPA in the United States, a survey of environmental ethics by the ‘founding father’ of the field, a history of ideas perspective on the cultural origins of the environmental crisis and possible faith-based repairs.",

This course is about Muslims in America, past, present, and future, and how American Islam is an extension of global Islam and the ways it is uniquely American. As we study religious identity and understandings of Islam in enslaved Muslim narratives, the civil rights movement, waves of immigration, pre- and post- 9/11, and the current Muslim ban, we pay close attention to theorizations of contested histories, race, gender, and class dynamics, intersectionality, model minorityhood, assimilation, discrimination, and Malcolm X’s visit to Dartmouth College, the history and the significance of the Malcolm X murals in the Shabazz building.",

The unprecedented fusion Dante made of these elements in the Commedia [The Divine Comedy] has guaranteed his great poem a vast public, extending across world cultures and the seven centuries since it initially traveled among elite readers in north-central Italy in the early decades of the fourteenth century. This course will first examine the development of Dante’s poetic voice in La vita nova [The New Life, ca. 1293-94] and then focus on its subsequent expansion into an all-encompassing vision of life and death in Inferno [Hell, ca. 1306-09], the first of the three canticles of the Commedia. Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante’s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why – in the words of Italo Calvino – it “has not finished saying what it has to say.” Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work – to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project – will be in English. Students taking the course for major or minor credit will attend a weekly X-hour and write the two essays in Italian.",

Then we’ll move on to explore a wide range of topics from throughout the Buddhist world—such as the economic and political power of the nuns’ order in parts of East Asia; the death of the nuns’ order and the phenomenon of low-status “unofficial” nuns throughout much of Southeast Asia; the power of yoginis and other non-monastic spiritual roles for women in Tibet; the increasing phenomenon of Western nuns; and the feminist possibilities (or impossibilities) inherent in Buddhist doctrine. The term will conclude with a sustained look at the contemporary global movement to re-establish the valid ordination lineage for nuns throughout the world—a movement in which the voices arguing “for” and “against” are not always what one might presume them to be.",

However, there are key differences in how Buddhism developed and how the religion functions today. In South Korea, most people classify themselves as Buddhist or Christian; in Japan, the majority consider themselves non-religious, yet visit Buddhist temples and hold Buddhist funerals; in North Korea, roughly 10,000 Buddhists remain in spite of religious persecution by the state. Clerical marriage is widely accepted in Buddhist sects throughout Japan, whereas the practice has been the subject of heated debate in South Korea since the 1950s. How did these differences emerge, and what common ground remains?",

We will approach the material as scholars of history, literature, and religion. We expect to attend closely to the gendered and racialized representations of Jewishness and Christianness in the play and in English culture more generally. The impact of the play will be examined with particular reference to modern German and English literary traditions. We will also examine some major developments in the staging of the play, with particular attention to Yiddish versions, Israeli productions, and Nazi-era German stagings, as well as several film versions. A selection from the major critical literature on the play will be studied.",

    "description": "This course examines twentieth and twenty-first century social struggles through a religious lens. Karl Marx famously described religion as the “opiate of the masses.” In practice, however, religion has been a resource for resistance as well as a mechanism of control. Drawing on case studies from the U.S. and Latin America, this course analyses how both sides of a conflict understand and deploy religious concepts. How do those in power approach religion? How does this differ from how those outside power structures mobilize it? How do uses of religion evolve to accommodate different cultural contexts and new political circumstances? These are some of the questions this course will consider in preparation for analyzing contemporary movements such as Standing Rock and Black Lives Matter.",

No serious medieval thinkers would have found that credible. Their moral and intellectual ideals were thoroughly elitist. Nevertheless, some of them were committed to progressive political ideals, which constitute the Enlightenment toward which they worked, often at considerable personal risk. Maimonides' work epitomizes this type of Enlightenment, both in its arguments and in the style of its esotericism. The seminar will strive to achieve a synoptic view of this classic of Western religious-political thought.\"",

    "description": "We will explore a wide variety of domestic and foreign media including film, music, jokes, detective novels, and streaming online videos across the Soviet period and into the present time. Artistic disciplines during the Soviet period were firmly entrenched within cultural industries that featured union memberships, the means to control production, distribution, and exhibition. Nonetheless, what was popular throughout Russo-Soviet history did not always emanate from state guided channels. How do we account for what we perceive as “anomalies” in Russian popular culture: why did people listen to American jazz music under Stalin? Why were Bollywood films more popular than Soviet comedies? Why were Brazilian and Mexican telenovelas standard viewing in Soviet homes? How did the presence of foreign texts relate to the multi-ethnic makeup on the Soviet Union? How were founding mythologies of the nation encoded/rejected in domestic texts?   While popular culture encompasses a multitude of media, special attention will be paid to trends in music and cinema, offering students a comprehensive, historical arc of each medium’s development in Russia. The course will seek to establish a working definition of what we actually mean by “Russian popular culture.” Firstly, how do we differentiate between categorizations of mass culture versus popular culture? Secondly, we will challenge the notion of national culture when referring to the terms “Russian” and “Soviet” culture throughout the semester. Each unit is organized around the construct of “svoi” (“ours”) vs. “chuzhoi” (“theirs”), offering the class a point of comparison for how domestically produced culture often rivaled official foreign imports and blackmarket, unofficial distributed products. We will also explore larger, universal questions that revolve around top-bottom and bottom-up models of how popular culture operates. What does popular culture mean in the capitalist market context, and how might that definition change under socialism?",

    "description": "In his Philosophical Letters, Pyotr Chaadaev, a 19th century Russian intellectual, compared Russian history to the history of Western civilization. Chaadaev proclaimed that Russia had been cut off from the global community, belonged to no cultural system, and contributed nothing to the progress of the human spirit. Since then, Russian writers and thinkers have wrestled with Chaadaev’s categorical verdict. One response from the 20th century poet Osip Mandelstam pointed out that Chaadaev had overlooked one singular contribution: the Russian language. “Such a highly organized, such an organic language is not merely a door into history, it is history itself.” Taking Mandelstam’s point to its logical conclusion, it is Russia’s literature that becomes the Rosetta stone to the exceptional nature of the Russian experience. In this course, we will explore some of the texts that make up this Rosetta stone. While reading some of the most celebrated works from 19th century Russian fiction – texts by Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Turgenev, Goncharov, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov – we will attempt to account for the distinct character of Russian literature and its unique role in Russian history and culture.",

As we read and discuss novels, stories, poems, and plays written by the Russian writers of that time, we will consider the correlations and tensions between the Russian sociohistorical reality and artistic expression. In addition to readings from literary and historical sources, we will watch films created by some of the most celebrated Russian filmmakers as a well as the recent controversial documentary The Soviet Story produced by Latvian director Edvins Snore.",

He found temporary relief in war and in marriage, but the definitive solution always eluded him. The evolution of this theme, and the formal devices by which Tolstoy expressed it in his prose, will be traced in the major novels, War and Peace and Anna Karenina.

Among the questions that our course will ask: how is our determination of what is “mad” dependent on cultural norms? Do different societies generate different types of madness? To what degree are Western psychological theories and models relevant to non-Western cultures? What are the uses of madness from a social, political, and literary point of view?

In this interdisciplinary course, you will learn about the ‘new Russia’ that has emerged in the three decades since that stunning collapse. Drawing on a wide variety of resources in English translation—from Russian films and novels to YouTube videos and social media posts—you will navigate the diverse technologies and media products that are helping to shape contemporary Russian identity. You will explore, for example, the ‘violent entrepreneurship’ of oil oligarchs, the cynicism of state-funded television propagandists, and the avant-garde theatrics of Moscow’s feminist dissidents. Your study of Putin’s Russia should also allow us to discuss some of the most pressing questions facing citizens in a democracy today: What is the nature of truth in the digital age? How do content creators and media consumers determine what is credible? What factors and forces are shaping the messages we consume through our televisions, tablets, and smartphones, and how can we learn to critically evaluate these messages in order to lead better lives?",

Finally, each student will undertake their own creative writing project, which will center on a specific literary genre and a specific topic chosen as the cultural-historical focus for the course. For the Fall of 2017, this topic will be the 1960s-70s in Ukraine, which, at that time, was part of the Soviet Union. Each student will write one short story, set in 1960-70s Ukraine, and written from the perspective of an imaginary, yet historically grounded, narrator. The reading list for the course will include some of the best short stories written in the Russian and the Ukrainian languages as well as collateral texts and films of various genres devoted primarily to the 1960s-70s in Ukraine and the Soviet Union.

It is therefore essential that we understand the operation of conspiracy narrative, its psychological allure and political function, and its devastating social consequences. In this course, we will investigate two national conspiracist traditions, the American and the Russian, and the parallel rise and stunning convergence of Russian and American conspiracism in our current political moment. In order to do so, we will inquire into the historical origins, the form, function, and effectiveness of conspiracist narratives in these two traditions in the 20th and 21st centuries. Ultimately we will approach conspiracy theories as ways of knowing, of penetrating and ordering complex and opaque realities. They are also powerful narrative weapons that imperil the shared truths on which cohesive societies are based. Our course texts include The Master and Margarita (Bulgakov), The Crucible (Miller), and Libra (DeLillo), Ivan the Terrible Part II (Eisenstein) The Manchurian Candidate (Frankenheimer) and The Matrix (The Wachkowskis) as well as literary and cultural studies of conspiracist narrative and ideation.",

This course will include a series of drawing/media/design assignments that will serve as concentrated exercises in the investigation of architectural and spatial concepts and projects for challenged communities on the local, national and international levels. A wide array of design tools will be utilized and students will work both individually and collaboratively with classmates.  Course requirements will consist of the completion of drawing, model making and analysis assignments associated with each of the phases of the course. A substantial part of many class sessions will be dedicated to working on these assignments in the studio, thus attendance will be critical to the successful completion of the course. There will be a time commitment required outside of class to complete most assignments and additional assignments will also be made explicitly for completion outside of class. Field trips, site visits and visiting experts will be an integral component of the course.",

In the spirit of its subject, students will utilize a range of media with the goal of visualizing the relation between medium and concept, art and thought, self and world. Some of the questions we will be asking are: how do we identify issues and formulate questions in visual terms?  What are the advantages and disadvantages, limitations and possibilities of each medium?

Yet rarely are such reports accompanied by a discussion of the systematic causes of these problems. More often we become witness to an endless stream of media coverage reporting seemingly isolated incidents. Seldom are we informed of the decision-making process by which some social problems become selected for coverage, while others are ignored. The purpose of this course is to subject the coverage of modern social problems to an in-depth, critical analysis. We will attempt to answer such questions as: \"how does a social problem become defined as such?\" and \"what are the causes or sources of various social problems?\" Open to all classes.",

What does this mean for public policy, population health and aging, fertility and reproductive health, immigration and social inequality? To gain insight into these questions, social scientists study some of life’s most intimate moments – sex, illness and death, and moving from home to home. These components of population change (mortality, fertility, and migration) help us better understand the impact of population composition and change. In this class, we will first learn the basic tools that social scientists use to analyze broad population trends. We will then use these tools to gain insight into population patterns across the globe. At the end of the course, students will apply what they learned to the analysis of the population trends of a country of their choice, as well as compare and contrast population trends across different countries.",

The course begins with a discussion of major theories of revolutions, including works that focus on class analysis, ideological conflicts, and the state. In the second half of the term, the course explores the revolutions in Iran, Nicaragua, and the Philippines, focusing on the causes of the conflicts, the revolutionary processes, and their alternative outcomes: Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, revolutionary socialism in Nicaragua, and the restoration of liberal democracy in the Philippines. The latter part of the course relies on documentary films that contain actual footages of the revolutionary struggles and their outcomes in the three countries.",

    "description": "Sociologists and other social scientists are often interested in understanding causal and dynamic social processes such as:\n“How do the places we live, work, and play get under the skin and affect health and well-being across the life course?”\n“Does upward social class mobility change one’s political attitudes?”\n“What social currents are responsible for changes in support for same-sex marriage across historical time?” \n“Are long-standing racial inequalities declining, persisting, or increasing in recent years?”\nMany of these questions are methodologically difficult to answer with observational (non-experimental) data, and they require that we get a handle on the study of change, context, and causality. You likely have learned how to answer questions like these with standard OLS (linear) regression techniques and cross-sectional data, which remain useful tools in social scientists’ methodological toolbox. But these techniques are also quite limited, and impose strict assumptions that do not allow us to meet many of our goals, adequately answer our questions, or provide stringent tests of our theories and hypotheses.\nIn this course, we’ll pick up where introductory statistics courses leave off, and get an introduction to more advanced statistical methods for observational data, including but not limited to: regression for categorical dependent variables, fixed and random effects models, and hierarchical linear modeling. This course will be a mix of seminar and lecture, where we will be focused on understanding how we can use these methods to better meet our goals and answer our research questions. Put differently, this course is less focused on going “under the hood” and more focused on “how to drive”—specifically, we will interrogate the assumptions and use of these statistical methods in the social sciences and learn how to implement these methods using STATA. This will include: discussion of core methodological assumptions and limitations, how to apply these statistical methods in different settings, and learning when specific methods are appropriate tools and when they are not. We will explore these issues through student-led discussions, hands-on data analysis, and dissecting the application of these methods in academic journal articles. As part of this course, you will be exposed to (and critique) a wide range of sociological research published in our major disciplinary journals. The course will culminate in an independent research project where students will analyze data and use the one or more of the modeling techniques discussed during the term to answer a sociological research question of their choosing.

Wright Mills described \"the sociological imagination\" as that quality of mind with the ability to grasp the interplay of biography and history, of self and social structure, of private troubles and public issues. As we venture into the 21st century, various issues of class, race and gender inequalities and conflicts appear to dominate popular discourse and policy debates. This capstone seminar will explore current substantive and theoretical expressions of the sociological imagination for providing critical assistance in understanding some of the major social issues of our time. The seminar is designed to emphasize critical discussion through active participation and class presentations. Each student will complete a significant intellectual project which reflects her or his own sociological analysis about an important social issue.

This course will provide students with tools to understand tango as music, poetry, dance, language (lunfardo), and melodrama, from the 19th century to its current state of political resistance and globalized commodification.

Using the image of the slaughterhouse in texts and images spanning 250 years of Southern cone history, we will explore various issues and debates within animal studies, from animal rights and biopolitics to modernization of killing, exploitation of bodies and zones of indetermination between animals and humans.

But that is of course a prejudice from our modern times that need to be debunked in light of social attitudes towards power documented during that time period. We will explore salient cases from political revolution to subtle resistance in early modern texts and images of Spain and Spanish America.

His early work showed the influence of the Enlightenment and had a critical point of view that aimed to not only please but also educate his viewers. As time went by, the ravages of illness, war, and political repression showed in his paintings through impactful and enigmatic imagery that upended the traditional role of an artist and that has earned him a relevant place in contemporary Spanish culture, as shown in his numerous films that bring him alive. Although he became a court painter and was well connected to the monarchy, a closer look to his paintings reveals a critical stance that urges his viewers to reflect on the lack of meaning in modern society. From the royal tapestries and portraits, to the incisive Caprichos, the impactful Disasters of the War and the desperate Black Paintings, we will examine the history of Spain through Goya's major works, not only as subject but also as object of representation in literature and in films.",

Gabriel García Márquez’s novel opens up a magical world where the boundaries that separate fantasy and reality, fairy tale and history seem to dissolve naturally. And yet, no fictional work has ever been more deeply grounded in the reality and history of a people. The book tells the incredible story of the Buendía family as it develops through the successive cycles of destruction and rebirth that shape history in the mythical world of Macondo. As the story unfolds it illuminates the wonders and terrors of the history of Latin American countries, the complexities and contradictions that have defined their peoples, and shaped their cultures. In this course we will read enjoy and analyze One Hundred Years of Solitude as well as a selection of García Márquez’s short stories and journalistic works. The works will be discussed within the framework of major theoretical and historical issues and in constant dialogue with a variety of secondary sources.",

As early as the 18th and 19th centuries, painters such as José Campeche and Francisco Oller appropriated European traditions to imagine and depict Puerto Rican cultural autochthony. Twentieth and twenty-first century artists have radicalized their works to question the legitimacy of artistic institutions and the capitalist logic of the art market. Film, photography, media, literature, theater, and performance also deploy the decolonizing Boricua Gaze to shed light on Puerto Rico’s colonial condition, while muralism, parades, and public street festivals in the Puerto Rican enclaves of the US serve as visual forms of resistance against gentrification, political corruption, and the violent policing of brown and black bodies. Students in this senior seminar will engage with a broad repertoire of artistic and material practices in order to produce interdisciplinary scholarship that reflects the historical, social, and political dimensions of Puerto Rican visual cultures.",

In order to understand a play, a theater artist must first learn to “read music.” This course will focus on the tools that allow an artist to understand the dramatic “score” and ultimately to translate the playwright’s words into action on stage. The playwright’s tools: Style, Setting, Mood, Theme, Environment, Character, Language, Action, Objective, Obstacles, will be defined and discussed.  The reading list will include plays by Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Katori Hall, William Shakespeare, Lynn Nottage, Caryl Churchill, and others.

The course will feature multiple visits with artists who are in residence, performing, or developing interdisciplinary work at the Hopkins Center. We will experience works live when possible and view video documentation of many others. Artists’ writings and articles from performing arts journals will offer theory and context.\n As a discussion-based seminar, active participation during class is essential as we seek to situate performances within their sociopolitical and artistic contexts and conceptualize the role and possibilities of performance in our rapidly changing world, including its potential to reflect and reshape its cultures and societies. In addition to gaining critical perspective and honing analytical skills, students in this course will join with those in THEA 90 for an intensive hands-on workshop in physical theater technique led by Quinn Bauriedel of the Pig Iron School for Advanced Performance Training.

Race, migration, and sexuality are experienced differentially across all groups and individuals. They also have distinctive transnational and diasporic histories and practices. This course will focus on the various groups that have comprised the United States in a comparative and decolonial study aligned with the intersectional approach advocated by black feminists. Students will learn about issues of race, migration, and sexuality across time and space, as critical dimensions of the nation’s political and economic structures, within different ethnocultural traditions, and in aesthetic, performance practices. The central object is to weave diverse historical and cultural traditions into a larger synthesis of the meaning of race, migration and sexuality in North American life that is deftly attuned to power in all of its guises and establishmentarian logics.\nAs a broad introduction to the multi- and inter-disciplinary studies in race, migration, and sexuality, the course will employ “a constellated approach” that will highlight the connections between our interdisciplinary programs with components of study in U.S. ethnicities, genders and indigeneities. It will enable students to think across the fields of Latinx, African, Native and Asian American Studies while also encouraging thinking in global, hemispheric, transnational and decolonial terms. The course will promote interest in border thinking across geographies and practices that demand a fundamental rethinking of existing paradigms with new questions, objects and analytics",

Through close readings of both primary sources (in translation) and secondary literature — including historiographical, theoretical, and literary texts as well as film and music— we will also tackle the questions, controversies, and stereotypes that have animated debates in both scholarly and popular literature on such topics as the veil, feminism, revolution, human rights, LGBT issues, masculinity, and war.",

We will also examine the evolution and contributions of the female justices of the U.S. Supreme Court and observe how their experiential rhetoric informs the Court’s opinions.",

Each week, students will examine a performance at the limit of action, including passivity, silence, and endurance, alongside issues related to gender, sexuality, labor, and immigration among others. How might we approach and reconcile with performances that once again reify notions of racialized and gendered bodies as apolitical, passive, submissive, and compliant? Drawing on scholarship within black and women of color feminist criticism, queer theory, critical ethnic studies, Asian American Studies, and performance studies, this course will attune students to the role of aesthetics to interrogate and expand what we typically conceive of as activism, resistance, and survival from racialized, feminized, and queer positions.",

Through the lens of feminist and queer of color performance, we will engage a diverse array of aesthetic forms—including performance and installation art, literature, poetry, film, music, and new media— in order to learn how cultural practitioners use the arts to sustain life in a world framed by overlapping legacies of white supremacy, colonialism, capitalism, and heteropatriarchy. Our readings and materials will be interdisciplinary, spanning gender and queer studies, critical ethnic studies, American studies, and performance studies. Traversing 20th and 21st century cultural production, each week will be organized around artists and writers who actively engage the concept of memory as a political act against the denial or disavowal of violence. We set out to understand the social, political, and economic contexts in which artists create their work, addressing issues of race, gender, sexuality, nation, class, ability, and environmental decay. In doing so, we come to more intimately know how performances of time, memory, and trauma include a fervent belief in the potential of queer and feminist possibility.

Taking our cue from Adrienne Rich, who ambiguously titles one book of essays On Lies, Secrets and Silences (is she for or against?), we will follow debates about what makes it possible to break previous silences--and to what degree and in what ways it is useful or satisfying to do so. Topics within this discussion will include sexuality, race, illness, literary modes, female literary succession, and relations with the literary tradition. We will read in the work of eight or nine poets and recent critical and theoretical writings, with some attention in the first weeks to important female and male precursors. The syllabus will include such writers as Edna St.Vincent Millay, HD, Gertrude Stein, Elizabeth Bishop, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Marilyn Hacker, Louise Gluck, Rita Dove.",

    "description": "For the first time in literary history, women writers found commercial and critical success in England during the nineteenth century. Women writers of this time were keen observers of the social codes that formed—and constrained—their identities. Though women wrote in many genres in this period, this course will focus on major novels of the nineteenth century because of the particular strategies female novelists used to open up hard questions about social identity, and particularly social possibilities for women. Questions about gender clearly implicate sexuality, class, ethnicity, race, and power, as well, in complex, compelling, and unexpected ways. We will read works by Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Emily Brontë, Charlotte Brontë, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot, and we will end the class by reading substantial excerpts from the private, unpublished diaries of the women writers who published as “Michael Field.”",

While the course will begin with a brief consideration of the conventions and early history of the genre, most of the course will examine post-1970s (most American) young adult novels. We'll trave the evolution of the genre in relation to ideas of racial innocence, sentimentality, consent, queer childhood, and revolutionary girlhood, and position the novels within historical contexts such as the rise of mass incarceration, settler colonialism, fantasies of post-racial politics, and environmental disaster. At the end of the course, we'll consider how young adult novels have created not just reading but creative communities and explore the kinds of fan productions that have emerged in relation to young adult novels. The course will include critical and creative assignments. Texts may include The Hunger Games; the Harry Potter series; Are You There God, It's Me Margaret; The Outsiders; The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing; Vivian Apple at the End of the World; Fangirl; Artistotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe; Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian; The Fault in Our Stars; Ship Breaker; Long Division; Monster; Akata Witch; Make Your Home Among Strangers.",

How might the “bad” and the “queer” name the refusal and failure to assimilate and align oneself with racial capital, settler colonial logics, and reproductive futurity? How might both terms require us to rethink what narratives of belonging look, feel, and sound like and in turn, become the grounds for alternative solidarities, affiliations, and intimacies across lines of minority difference? To answer these questions, we will engage with primarily contemporary Asian/American works of literature, poetry, film, performance, and art that alters, disrupts, and varies Asian/American narratives of migration, assimilation, and upward mobility. Through these works, we will address historical processes of Asian/American racial, gender, and sexual formation by way of the “bad” and the “queer,” as transformative political and aesthetic categories of inquiry that risk failing to fit in, being wrong, and not belonging.",

We will begin by examining revolutionary nationalist and anti-imperialist culture in the Americas—ranging from the memoirs of Che Guevara and Malcolm X to Nuyorican and Chicano Movement literature—in order to consider the formation of revolutionary subjects, and how 20th century ideas of revolution were raced and gendered. We will then consider how novelists, artists, photographers, filmmakers, and activists attempted to imagine solidarity with revolutionary movements and suffering others in the Americas, from Central America solidarity photography to performance art in solidarity with Guantanamo Bay prisoners.

Our focus will be on the representation of women and female agency in this case study of India as we explore how knowledge is created, by whom, and to what ends. Language is a powerful instrument. We will analyze how language has been and is currently used to portray India, as we will think critically about how our perceptions of India have been shaped by what we have read, heard, and seen. Some questions we will address are: How have images of India been constructed over time? To what ends? What impact has colonialism had on how India was portrayed to the west? How did/do Indian writers use language to reclaim their country? How is feminism defined in India? How can we understand female agency in the Indian context?

Moreover, proponents of sexual science in Europe and North America adopted notions forged in exchange with actors in Asia, Latin America and Africa, e.g., the US practice of gender reassignment surgery was heavily influenced by earlier Mexican cases or the German legal understanding of homosexuality was tested and contested in its colonial African courts.  We will study many figures who have been forgotten in contemporary work on sexuality or sexual science.  Some of these figures drew from the repressive legal, social and cultural discourses that limited sexual expression and gave the ideological grounds to discrimination and persecution.  But others—and they were at times the very same figures—connected to the liberating discourses, the power of which we are experiencing today.",

Through a reading of Freud’s texts on gender, sexuality, and religion, we will trace the connections between psychoanalysis, Jewishness, and gender that have impacted theoretical discussion. We will explore critique, including Horney, Reich, and Marcuse, and recent debate on the status of Freud in the U.S.",

    "description": "Lauded as an extraordinary and unprecedented international free speech forum, the Internet, with its protection of anonymity, lack of systematic oversight, and instantaneous global reach, can be a powerful tool for positive social change. At the same time, increasing incidents of hate crimes in cyberspace serve to harass, intimidate, threaten, and silence those in already marginalized groups and activists fighting for social justice. This course will explore questions such as: How is Internet speech (including images, videos, and music) structured by racial, sexual, gendered, national, global, and colonial inequalities in different contexts? How do new media technologies and social networking sites change the possibilities for community organizing, public protests, social movements, access to censored material, and coalition building? How, if at all, should the Internet be regulated in order to promote free speech values? What are these values? Are they universal or do they differ depending on time, place, and culture?",

To achieve this excellence, WRIT 2 - WRIT 3 enrolls students into intensive, seminar-style classes in which literary and other works (including the students' own) are read closely, with attention to substance, structure, and style. The primary goal of WRIT 2 is for students to learn to write clearly and with authority. By submitting themselves to the rigorous process of writing, discussing, and rewriting their papers, students come to identify and then to master the essential properties of the academic argument.  In WRIT 3, students engage in the more sustained discourse of the research paper. These papers are not restricted to literary criticism but might employ the research protocol of other academic disciplines. Throughout the reading, writing, and research processes, students meet regularly with their teaching assistants and professors, who provide them with individualized assistance.  Note: Writing 2-3 is taken in place of Writing 5. Students must complete both terms of Writing 2-3 and a First-year Seminar to fulfill the first-year writing requirement. Students who take the WRIT 2 - WRIT 3 sequence defer their First-year Seminar until the spring term. Writing 2-3 does not serve in partial satisfaction of the Distributive Requirement.",
