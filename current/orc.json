Rather than approaching the economy as an abstraction that exists apart from human societies, we will critically explore how it is created and experienced through activities and relationships that are part of everyday life.\nOur focus will be on how markets, commodities, labor, property, and money shape people’s identities and relationships. We will pay particular attention to the ways that power works, often invisibly, through economic forms, and how this can make inequality and governmental power appear acceptable and even natural. Finally, we will examine relations between “the economy” and “the environment” in the context of climate change and environmental degradation.

For instance, over the last few decades, Singapore, Shanghai, and Seoul have distinguished themselves as points of reference for other aspiring cities in and beyond Asia. How have Asian cities transformed in an interconnected global economy? How does an interdisciplinary reading of Asian cities provide ways to think anew about Asia today?\n            With Asia at the center of our urban inquiries, this course proposes to read Asian cities from historical and comparative perspectives. The primary purpose of this course is to introduce students to multiple disciplinary approaches to Asia’s urban environments and their dynamic relationships to other parts of the world.

Effective scientists are continually absorbing, conceiving, sorting, discarding, and refining models. All scientists are modelers, but many of us mainly do it unconsciously, and almost all of us would be better scientists if we were better modelers.

Or must a background desire to do the right thing be involved? Is all human motivation, by its nature, self-interested? Or is genuine altruism possible?

In this class we will read, and bring together in conversation, cutting edge work from philosophy, psychology, and the neurosciences on the nature of consciousness.",

It turns out that if you want the protocol to be fault-tolerant, i.e., the protocol works correctly even if one of the agents stops communicating, it is impossible to design a correct protocol (under certain reasonable assumptions about the system).\nIn the course, we will look at several fascinating coordination problems and solve them for several models of distributed computing: shared-memory versus message passing, synchronous versus asynchronous, fault-free versus fault-tolerant.

To understand the behavior of complex systems, we must study not only the parts but the emergent behavior that arises from such systems when the parts act together. Complex systems are by definitions highly interconnected, therefore, at the core of studying complex systems is understanding networks. This seminar is an introduction to the main concepts of networks and complex systems, and their applications. The topics covered in this course will include: network topologies, network dynamics, motifs, dynamic systems, attractors, and chaos. The seminar mainly involves reading and discussing seminal, and ongoing, works in this field, but we will also be doing hands-on modeling and studying toy and real networks using Python.",

Although Smart Things offer many potential benefits, they can also create unsafe conditions and increase risk of harm to persons and property. This course explores the key security and privacy challenges required for the vision of Smart Homes to be safely realized, with an explicit focus on consumer-facing “things” where end-user privacy and usability are essential. It will take a holistic approach to the entire lifecycle of security, privacy, and usability challenges from the perspective of the everyday consumer who interacts with Smart Things (intentionally or unintentionally) in a residential setting. Students will read, present, and discuss papers from the research literature; write a survey paper about a subset of the research literature; and conduct a security analysis of a current commercial “smart thing”. Guest lecturers will join the class, weekly, to share expertise from both industry and research.",

    "description": "How can we practice \"immersion journalism,\" as creative nonfiction is sometimes described, when writing about people and events of the past? In this creative nonfiction writing course, we'll immerse ourselves in the kind of research that will allow us to recreate moments and moods for which we couldn't be present. We'll become witnesses at a remove; and, through careful attention to our own roles in the construction of our stories, participant-observers, as well. We'll learn how to use archives; make creative use of documents and artifacts; engage with scholarly historical writing as a source for creative writing; and interrogate our assumptions about research and representation, all in the service of character-driven narratives as vivid, nuanced, and dramatic as writing based on contemporary fieldwork. This course is an attempt to raise the dead, to resurrect truths from dormant facts, to find stories of the present within the past. You'll write two short nonfiction stories, of a person and a place, based on secondary sources, and one long narrative based on original research. The texts we'll be reading, by Lauren Redniss, John D'Agata, Svetlana Alexievitch, Joe Sacco, Maggie Nelson, and Michael Lesy, among others, vary radically in form and medium, as may your own experimental nonfictions",

The United States has always figured heavily in the collective French imaginary ever since the American Revolution, for instance in the works of Tocqueville and Chateaubriand. American literature, however, gains particular prominence toward the mid-twentieth century with the transatlantic travels of Simone de Beauvoir, André Breton, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Philippe Sollers among authors, to the point that French writers began wondering how one can even be French in the first place. The course explores this crisis in national identity through a series of important poetic Franco-American friendships and collaborations: Edmond Jabès and Rosmarie Waldrop; Emmanuel Hocquard and Michael Palmer; Serge Pey and Allen Ginsberg; the Fondation Royaumont; the poetry collective double change; among others.",

A colossal influence on generations of writers, and readers, including T.S. Eliot, Derek Wolcott, Edna O’Brien and countless others, Ulysses is, among many other things, challenging, irreverent, thought-provoking, political, technically virtuosic, and above all wildly entertaining. Students will read some outside sources on Joyce but for the most part our primary text will be Joyce’s own words – wherever they lead us. Prepare to meet a fascinating and chaotic cast of characters featuring – Lilly, Kate and Julia Morkan, Gabriel Conroy, Stephan Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom, and many others.

Such writers as Toni Morrison, Thomas Pynchon, Maxine Hong Kingston, Leslie Silko, Norman Mailer, Don DeLillo, and Ralph Ellison, among others, have produced a body of important, innovative fiction expressive of a modern American literary sensibility. The course requires intensive class reading of this fiction and varied critical writing on postmodernism.",

The course will begin with an introduction to some of the key concepts in Marxist and psychoanalytic thought, specifically as these two traditions understand colonialism. Then, we will read the work of postcolonial thinkers, such as Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, and Homi Bhabha, to consider their critiques of colonial thought and practices. Throughout the course, we will attend to the way in which racial and sexual difference is considered in the readings.

In this course, we'll explore stories of borderlands, wildernesses, colonies, voyages, and migration. As we read widely in literature and travel narratives—including Shakespeare's defense of refugees from the forgotten play, Sir Thomas More—we'll consider what borderlands offer the early modern imagination and what they looked like in reality.

    "description": "F. O. Matthiessen coined the term “American Renaissance” in his groundbreaking book, The American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman (1941). At the outset of the nineteenth century American writers struggled with a sense of cultural inferiority and artistic belatedness. The “American Renaissance” demarcates a period as well as a cultural movement marked by intense literary activity between the 1830s and 1860s that aimed at the formation of a distinctively American literature. Matthiessen restricted the American Renaissance to the years between 1850 and 1855, an “extraordinarily concentrated moment of literary expression” (vii) that saw the publication of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, House of the Seven Gables, and The Blithedale Romance; Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Representative Men; Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick; Henry David Thoreau’s Walden; and Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. In the years since the publication of Matthiessen’s important work, teachers and scholars in American literature have extended the American Renaissance’s chronological provenance at least as far back as the anti-slavery debates in the 1830s and as far forward as the termination of the Civil War. In the past several decades, Matthiessen’s argument has been challenged for its exaggeration of the originality of his coterie of male authors, for the exclusion of women and African-American and popular authors from his account of the United States during a period of remarkable social and cultural transformation, and for its seemingly uncritical acceptance of the doctrine of American exceptionalism. In light of these criticisms, scholars have added Emily Dickinson, Frederick Douglass, Margaret Fuller, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Mark Twain (among others) to Matthiessen’s American Renaissance pantheon.",

What made these stories so popular in the nineteenth century, and why do they continue to enchant readers? This course explores the genre of Victorian children’s literature in relation to such themes as Romantic innocence, nature and animal studies, climate change, sexuality and queerness, evolution, colonialism and race, disability studies, global economics, and play. Throughout the course, we’ll think about how stories for children are constructed and how writers and artists have adapted these Victorian texts for later audiences (e.g. through film, graphic novels, and fan fiction).

Beginning in 1836 with Charles Dickens’ first novel, Victorian audiences often read texts as weekly and monthly ‘parts’ rather than as literary ‘wholes’. In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming, and in 2013, the company began producing original content. Instead of waiting a week for the next television episode, audiences could binge watch entire seasons (or more). Both the serial and digital streaming have been called revolutionary, but what does this mean? This course pairs Victorian serial novels and Netflix original series in order to think critically about structure and form. How does the play between serial part and whole necessitate new temporalities, strategies of characterization and narration, and types of suspense? How does binge-watching disrupt or reshape narrative time and sequencing? How have both new forms altered cultural discourses on gender, social consciousness, crime, and politics? How do narratives intersect with other types of seriality, including evolution, reproduction and inheritance, election cycles, and the #MeToo movement?

In this course we will, via the close reading of its literature and its history, create our own distinct blueprint of Dublin, and attempt to write our own narratives of the city. We will study the ways in which literature contributes to a particular imagined cosmopolitan that is not only necessary to the vital life of the city but also to the cultural identity of its people. Some of the writers to be considered include: James Joyce, Sean O’Casey, Samuel Beckett, Flann O’Brien, Aiden Higgins, Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh, Emma Donaghue, Claire Keegan, Roddy Doyle, Colm Tóibín, John Banville, Eavan Boland, Anne Hartigan, Kevin Barry, Bernard McLaverty, Patrick McGabe, Neil Jordan, Edna O’Brien, Sebastian Barry, Colum McCann, Eílís Ní Dhuibne and Anne Enright.

It examines the most well-known writer of the weird, H.P.

The course introduces students to the study of genre fiction, theoretical approaches to literature (including posthumanism, psychoanalysis, and ecotheory), and cultural studies (including critical race theory and feminism). It asks students to consider how weird fiction challenges racism, misogyny, homophobia, and colonialism. While no prior training in critical theory is necessary, students are encouraged to have some familiarity in analyzing and writing on literature.

They often bring powerful bicultural perspectives to their tasks of survival and opportunity seeking, however, and are increasingly active in struggles for cultural expression and social and economic justice. We will examine the different conditions for women in a variety of immigrant groups in America, reading in several histories, anthologies of feminist criticism, interdisciplinary surveys, and relevant texts in critical theory, and on the words, in autobiography, poetry, and fiction, of foreign-born women writers.

In the midst of such unrelenting violence, how have black people managed to love each other, love themselves, love living? What language have they crafted, historically, to describe such an expansive, radical project? For the purposes of this course, we will linger with a wide range of cinematic and literary moments with the aim of framing a much larger conversation about the uses of black art-making as a means through which we might access a critical vocabulary for black feeling; might assert the breaking into the world of a black love that is both resistance and that which exceeds it, love as a sort of black operation, black love as an act of marronage. Towards that end, this course will employ the films of contemporary writer and director Barry Jenkins, and place them in direct conversation with a larger constellation of writings within the African American literary tradition. Through our collective investigation of these texts, we will work together toward the elaboration of an aesthetics of black love.",

    "description": "Contemporary Britain can be seen as a divided state: leave versus remain, cosmopolitan urbanism against conservative rural communities, post-imperial malaise and the rise of global Anglophone influence. Britain is also a literary hotbed, home to the Man Booker Prize for Fiction and an arena in which cultural production (and social debates) still take the form of narrative. What is “Britain” at the start of the twenty-first century, in what is ostensibly a post-war, post-imperial, and post-modern era? How do fiction writers respond to the twin pulls of national nostalgia and multicultural, intersectional identities? How do experiments in narrative form and genre speak to the emergence of new social and political formations? How does contemporary British fiction adapt or respond to a longer (and well-established) lineage of UK novelists (from Austen and Dickens to Virginia Woolf)? This course focuses on British fiction published after 1980, including works by authors who identify as Black British, queer, feminist, Muslim, and immigrant. Possible authors include Zadie Smith, A. S. Byatt, Ian McEwan, Sarah Waters, Kazuo Ishiguro, Jeanette Winterson, and Hanif Kureishi.",

We will explore the shifting and ideological role of the Indian as tragic emblem, savage defender, spiritual ally, and modern foil. We will explore the complicated ways that the literary Indian has served to both authenticate and trouble the nation's founding narratives and desires, and more recently, to stand as a mythical antidote to postmodern crises of value, economics, ecology, and spirituality. We will consider the appeal of such tropes in particular regional and historical contexts, such as the Reconstruction South, as well as racial or ethnic ones, such as the African American appropriation of Indian resistance, nobility, and genealogies.",

Rather than study short stories, we will consider why novels, as longer forms of fiction, nevertheless include storytelling by characters. How does such storytelling work? We will read several twentieth-century novels in which characters telling stories function as means of reforming community. In novels and anthropological study, we will pay particular attention to the ways that storytelling can reconceive identities of individuals and of history, at times opening up both so that persons and history become diverse and extensive. The boundaries of community may also become extensive, resisting containment and refusing to conform to a common cultural identity. We will read Walter Benjamin’s essay “The Storyteller” as well as several critical essays focusing on storytelling. Novels will include William Faulkner’s The Hamlet and Absalom, Absalom, Michael Ondaatje’s The English Patient, and Toni Morrison’s Paradise.

While the course will begin with a brief consideration of the conventions and early history of the genre, most of the course will examine post-1970s (mostly American) young adult novels. We’ll trace the evolution of the genre in relation to ideas of racial innocence, sentimentality, consent, queer childhood, and revolutionary girlhood, and position the novels within historical contexts such as the rise of mass incarceration, settler colonialism, fantasies of post-racial politics, and environmental disaster. At the end of the course, we’ll consider how young adult novels have created not just reading but creative communities, and explore the kinds of fan productions that have emerged in relation to young adult novels. The course will include critical and creative assignments. Texts may include The Hunger Games; the Harry Potter series; Are You There God; It’s Me Margaret; The Outsiders; The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing; Vivian Apple at the End of the World; Fangirl; Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe; Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian; The Fault in Our Stars; Ship Breaker; Long Division; Monster; Akata Witch; Make Your Home Among Strangers.",

We expect to attend closely to the gendered and racialized representations of Jewishness and Christianness in the play and in English culture more generally. The impact of the play will be examined with particular reference to modern German and English literary traditions. We will also examine some major developments in the staging of the play, with particular attention to Yiddish versions, Israeli productions, and Nazi-era German stagings, as well as several film versions. A selection from the major critical literature on the play will be studied.",

During the semester, we discuss the techniques they use to portray the passage of geological time. We also question the political implications of these representations—what they tell us about society in the present. Finally, we consider deep time as an inspiration for new philosophical concepts. The course has three sections: “Deep Time and Early Science Fiction”; “Cold War Countercultures”; and “The Anthropocene.” In addition to essays and exams, we complete a field project about the Harvard Museum of Natural History.",

    "description": "In 1738, a hundred years before legal emancipation came to England’s New World slave colonies, Jamaica’s Maroons forced the colonial power to sign a treaty granting sovereignty to Maroon communities across the Caribbean island. As the first Africans in the New World to achieve this feat, Maroon warriors directly and indirectly influenced abolitionist and revolutionary movements throughout the Americas—including, of course, revolts in Haiti and the United States. These warriors continued to inspire the revolutionary actions of other oppressed and/or enslaved individuals for generations, and indeed, a revolutionary ethos pervades Jamaican culture and artistic production from the colonial period to the present moment. This course traces the impact of “Jamaican” revolutionary figures on other revolutionary figures and events worldwide. Moving chronologically, from colonialism to the present day, the course examines influences such as African/Jamaican Maroon leaders direct impact on other revolutions throughout the Americas; Mary Seacole’s exchanges with and impact on Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War; Marcus Garvey’s impact on the Harlem Renaissance and the Rastafari religion; Claude McKay’s revolutionary impact on vernacular poetics and on the “Red Scare;” Louise Bennett’s mid-twentieth century revolutionary, feminist, vernacular poetics and her impact on female performers in the Americas, Europe, and Africa; Bob Marley and Damian Marley’s impact on politics and revolutionary movements in Liberia and Ghana; and finally, the impact of Staceyann Chin’s outspoken poetics on LGBTQ rights in the Caribbean and in other marginalized African diasporic communities.",

We will survey works from a range of national traditions, examining the features of the case that enable it to operate in and across multiple genres and fields. Our discussions will center on questions of epistemology and form, as we ask what kind of knowledge cases transmit and how they transmit it. Do they depict exceptional phenomena, or do they seek to delineate the qualities that are representative of a given phenomenon? Who has the authority to tell stories about whom? Why are cases so often relayed in serial form?",

Shakespeare's sonnets, for example, with their erotic address to both a \"sweet boy\" (or \"master-mistress of my passion\") and the so-called Dark Lady, remain a flashpoint. On the English stage, cross-gender identification and same-gender romance was a constant presence, while in the streets of London, \"catamites,\" \"tribades,\" or acts of \"sodomy\" were supposed to be completely absent—from the eyes of the law, at least. What can the poetry and plays of William Shakespeare, Amelia Lanyer, Christopher Marlowe, Margaret Cavendish, John Donne, or Katherine Phillips teach us, not only about the historically-distant practices of the past, but about our methods, theories, terms and changing paradigms for studying such topics today? What does it mean to read an imaginative literature as an archive within an historically contingent body of knowledge?

The texts published in the UK, ranging from Marx and Engels’ The Communist Manifesto to Gothic novels and Pre-Raphaelite poems, do not always seem obviously radical or even similar to one another in theme and mood. Are these texts in fact revolutionary? Are any of the texts politically or socially conservative, or do they represent conservative characters or perspectives? Do they take revolutionary forms or structures? To what extent are the texts participating in the same public sphere and historical moment? In responding to these questions, this colloquium will read literary texts (by Gaskell, Dickens, Emily Bronte, Christina Rossetti, Browning, and Tennyson) alongside artistic and political manifestos, popular political poetry, visual images, scientific and critical prose, and contemporary literary criticism (feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, poststructuralist).

Since her death in 1886, rival editors have fought over Dickinson’s canon, producing their versions of her poetry. Likewise, biographers have romanticized her life, characterizing her as “The Belle of Amherst,” eccentric, reclusive and even a bit mad. This colloquium will introduce students to the “new” Dickinson that is emerging from the plethora of materialist, feminist, post-modernist, and cultural studies approaches. We will use digital archives to reread and reconsider Dickinson’s work and life. Finally, we will study the year 1862, an immensely productive time for Dickinson and the height of the Civil War, also the focus of an annual daily blog I am preparing.

Women writers of this time were keen observers of the social codes that formed—and constrained—their identities. Though women wrote in many genres in this period, this course will focus on major novels of the nineteenth century because of the particular strategies female novelists used to open up hard questions about social identity, and particularly social possibilities for women. Questions about gender clearly implicate sexuality, class, ethnicity, race, and power, as well, in complex, compelling, and unexpected ways. We will read works by Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Emily Brontë, Charlotte Brontë, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot, and we will end the class by reading substantial excerpts from the private, unpublished diaries of the women writers who published as “Michael Field.”",

The period witnessed the expansion of photography, the popularity of pseudo-sciences such as physiognomy and phrenology, and the “scientific” study of race—disciplines that focused on the policing of a material body. At the same time, the Victorian period witnessed the emergence of an alternative vector of realism that rejected an emphasis on the “seen” and expanded the categories of who and what could be represented: women, industrial workers, and people of color. In analyzing these competing fields of realism, this colloquium will read literary texts alongside artistic manifestos, scientific and pseudo-scientific prose, visual images, and contemporary literary criticism (poststructuralist, psychoanalytic, feminist, queer, performance theory, critical race).

How does the violence enacted on racialized, sexed, gendered subjects exclude such subjects from the category of the individual, rights-bearing human cemented in Western philosophy? How is this exclusion enacted on the very surface of the skin and distinctly felt on one’s body? Who gets to claim humanity and subjecthood, and who has never been able to make such a claim? The readings in this course give an account of how racialized, sexed, gendered subjects are made to bear histories of enslavement, dispossession, genocide, and colonialism in ways that might not always be visible, but instead are sensed, felt, and embodied. We will work with literature, performance, and art that elucidates the political, social, and aesthetic possibilities found in the nonhuman, animality, objecthood, flesh, viscera, and touch.",

    "description": "In a famous exchange, long-time “frenemies” Wallace Stevens and Robert Frost traded barbs:\n“The trouble with you, Robert, is that you write about – subjects.”\n“The trouble with you, Wallace, is that you write about – bric-a-brac.”\nNeither man was correct, but their characterizations hit a nerve, honing in on the kinds of superficial attributes that may render a first impression lasting . And while no one reads Stevens for his “bric-a-brac” many readers come to Frost for his subjects, which have been misunderstood and sentimentalized over time. It is important to remember, reading him now, that Frost’s New England was no Transcendental retreat, and no rural paradise; poor, depopulated by western expansion on the one hand, and the industrialization of mill towns on the other, it was a landscape of failed and abandoned farmsteads, old people and misfits left to fend on their own, worn-out fields, harsh climate, intellectually moribund and spiritually enervated. Frost came to this “subject” without illusions or bitterness and it is through this subject that we will begin to rethink his poetics and ideas. Using the extensive Frost archives in Rauner, students will be encouraged to undertake primary research alongside their reading of poems and criticism. The course will culminate in a substantial research paper or project, individually designed in consultation with the instructor.",

This course explores the psychoanalytic case study as a unique literary genre in its own right, one that falls between the medical case history and the novel proper. We will read Sigmund Freud's case studies through three modes of reading: psychoanalytic feminist criticism; paranoid and reparative reading from queer critique; and, symptomatic reading from Marxist criticism. The readings of the cases will therefore be supplemented by texts in queer and feminist theory, continental philosophy, and literary criticism. Throughout the quarter, we will use the cases to explore questions of racial and sexual difference, the body, trauma, the psyche, and memory.",

Given that we can never get inside the head (or leaf) of another species, can we really know anything about their consciousness? Writers and theorists have been asking these questions for centuries, often in dialogue with the science of animal behavior. This course looks at a contemporary multidisciplinary tradition that attributes sentience and communication to animals, plants, and fungi. Over the course of the term, we address three interlocking problems as they appear in a varied archive of print and visual media 1) the problem of accessing the subjective experience of other species 2) the problem of communicating with other species, and the question in what media it might be possible 3) the problem of communicating with other human beings about 1 and 2, and the question of what media best serve this purpose. We also ask what these aesthetic and theoretical traditions offer us now, during the “Anthropocene” or the current epoch when humans have become a geological force shaping the Earth. We ask whether or not they have the potential to interpret it from a different perspective, whether or not they can inform environmentalist politics, and what their implications might be for social justice. This advanced course in environmental media studies also incorporates readings that reflect on the field’s particular theories and practices.",

Should walking be regarded as a fundamental human activity or as a literary convention carried over into everyday life? Why has walking long been regarded as a vehicle for thought and discourse: a privileged mechanism of knowledge production? Is there a difference between a country walk and a city walk? What is the relationship between walking and time, walking and place? Why should walking have emerged, in certain works of contemporary literature, as a principled rejection of mechanization, modernity, and the capitalist mode of production? And what does walking mean for those who cannot walk? To address these questions, students will read texts by such practitioners and theorists of walking as Thoreau, Walter Benjamin, W. G. Sebald, Rebecca Solnit, Simon Armitage, Robert MacFarlane, Geoff Nicholson, and others. Students will also use their own walks as opportunities for composing works of critical self-reflection, observation, and world-making.",

The politics of these exchanges are not easy. There were wars and border skirmishes; the Norman and Angevin kings of England sought to subdue the Celtic kingdoms and extend their political influence by diplomacy, coercion and conquest, creating a dynamic that is in some ways parallel to, but also interestingly different from a modern Colonial/Postcolonial situation.  Readings may include early Arthurian material; Diarmaid and Grainne and the Anglo-French Tristan romances; Geoffrey of Monmouth's Life of Merlin and Merlinesque prophecies; the Welsh Mabinogi; lais by Marie de France and other writers; the borderland romance \"Fulk Fitz Warren\"; the anecdotes, satires and short romances of Walter Map; Gerald of Wales's ethnographic descriptions/ travelogues of Wales and Ireland.  All non-English texts will be read in translation, although students with some knowledge of French, Latin, or a Celtic language may wish to explore some readings in the original.

From The Scarlet Letter (1850) and Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1851-52) to Leaves of Grass (1855) and Lincoln’s “House Divided” Speech of 1858, the literary output of America in the 1850s provides us with a snapshot of a turbulent culture amidst unprecedented growth and crisis. Slavery and xenophobia, minstrelsy and mass entertainments, crowds, consumerism, and cities, the “woman question,” labor rights, economic panics, and the secularization of Christian sentiment—these are just some of the issues that clamor in the literature of the decade. Our texts shall represent the gorgeous miscellany that is the 1850s, drawing from both high and low culture, canonical and forgotten authors, and from both established genres and media like novels and slave narratives to more ephemeral ones like newspapers, almanacs, caricatures, and inscribed material objects. Classes will meet in Rauner so that we may use these and other period rarities to spawn discussion and topics for original, independent research.

First, we will spend the term engaging in an intensive, deliberately slow reading of Dickens’s Bleak House, which was published from March, 1852 to September, 1853, in 20 monthly parts. By spreading our reading of this long, complex novel over the span of the fall term, we will gain access to something like the experience of its first readers, who encountered the text in units of several chapters, separated by time. Second, we will put Dickens and Bleak House in conversation with three other novelists and novels that shared the moment in the marketplace: Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford, published serially and edited by Dickens in 1851-52, Charlotte Brontë’s Villette, published in 1853, and Anthony Trollope’s Barchester Towers, published in 1855. Through work in Rauner Library, we will learn about the material history of literary production in the mid-Victorian period, and through engagement with contemporary critical and theoretical texts, we will learn about the implications of the narrative experiments Dickens, Gaskell, Brontë, and Trollope undertook in the 1850s.

    "description": "In 1942, the literary critic Alfred Kazin dismissed the documentary movement of the 1930s as a \"sub-literature,\" a \"vast granary of facts\" from which poets and fiction writers might extract the raw material of true literature. Just a year before, though, James Agee and Walker Evans -- a journalist and photographer -- had published Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, a vast book, indeed, sprawling in its feverish devotion to the experimentation Agee and Evans believed necessary to even come close to telling a true story. Agee and Evans wanted it to be an object as much as a book, a challenge to literary culture; whatever it was, it wasn't \"sub\" anything. In this course we'll use the question of just what Agee's and Evan's combination of pictures and words might be as the heart of our exploration of the documentary sphere as encountered through the conjunction of text and image. In the first half of the course, we’ll be guided by critical thinkers as we look at creative works and write our own critical essays; in the second, we’ll be guided by creative work as we attempt our own even while we continue our conversations with more contemporary critical thinkers. Besides Agee and Evans, we’ll be encountering among others, photographers Robert Frank, Sally Mann, Stephen Shore, Helen Levitt, Wendy Ewald, Teju Cole, Jean Mohr, Tanja Hollander, and Roy DeCarava; literary journalists Leslie Jamison, Michael Lesy, John Jeremiah Sullivan, John Berger, and Charles Bowden; critics Susan Sontag, Roland Barthes, John Szarkowski, Jerry Thompson, Susie Linfield, Jeff Allred, and bell hooks; and poets Claudia Rankine, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, Donald Justice, and Kevin Young.",

We will also read critical responses to Morrison’s works. Required texts will include, The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, A Mercy, Conversations with Toni Morrison, and selected essays. Central to our exploration will be an analysis of Morrison’s observation that “the past affects the present.” Therefore, we will explore the social and historical factors that contribute to Morrison’s artistic constructions. Some of the issues we will examine include, alternative constructions of female community and genealogy, and representations of race, class, nationhood, and identity.",

    "description": "In light of recent protest movements that target issues of race and gender, the prescient words of numerous artists continue to be evoked and volleyed about in contemporary media outlets. Yet the contexts of many of these utterances are largely ignored. Delving into some of these contexts and engaging many of these artists’ larger oeuvre, this course is a multidisciplinary investigation of major protest poets of the twentieth century. It explores the ways in which poets living in the United States, and particularly members of historically marginalized communities, not only pushed back at the powers-that-be, but continuously saw and articulated themselves as simultaneously a part of and a part from larger “American” society. The course wrestles with the well-known and often contentious topics: race, class, and gender. Starting with turn-of-the-century writers like Claude McKay—whose words have become synonymous with outspoken critiques of World War I and the “Red Scare”—and ending with contemporary writers like Balakian and Chin, the course moves chronologically. Some of the writers it examines include, Peter Balakian, Amiri Baraka, Staceyann Chin, Lucille Clifton, Mayda Del Valle, Karen Garrabrant, Allen Ginsberg, Zbignew Herbert, Robert Lowell, Juan Felipe Herrera, Langston Hughes, Etheridge Knight, Denise Levertov, Haki Madhubuti, Jill McDonough, Claude McKay, Alice Notley, Emmy Perez, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, Sonia Sanchez, and Dorothy Tse.",

    "description": "Why read Freud? Many of his most famous ideas (the Oedipus Complex, for example) have been discredited, disparaged, devalued, decried. So why read Freud? Using that question — a question that, in its very persistence, already crystalizes all that is most troubling, provocative, and intriguing about the Freudian text — students in this class will read Freud for his enduring value as the inventor, in psychoanalysis, of one of modernity’s most disturbing art forms, as an influential theorist of figuration and representation, as a fearless inquirer into the mysteries of gender and sexuality, and as a speculative thinker who continues to have a hold on our imagination precisely because he could never quite come to grips with all that had a hold on his imagination. Above all, we shall read Freud for what he has to teach us about the importance of risking failure and embarrassment, of remaining restless and uncertain in respect to one’s own thinking, of finding oneself in over one’s head. The texts we shall use to pursue this line of inquiry may or may not include any of the following: Studies on Hysteria, The Interpretation of Dreams, Three Essays on Sexuality, the case histories of Dora and the Wolf Man, Papers on Metapsychology and on Technique, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety, Civilization and Its Discontents, and essays such as “Project for a Scientific Psychology,” “Screen Memories,” “The Uncanny,” “The Moses of Michelangelo,” “On Narcissism,” “Two Principles of Mental Functioning,” “A Child Is Being Beaten,” “The Economic Problem of Masochism,” “Constructions in Analysis,” “Analysis Terminal and Interminable,” and “Humor.”",

    "description": "Biopolitics, loosely defined as the reciprocal incorporation of politics and life, describes not merely the dominant form that politics takes today but also, arguably, the form that politics has always taken. Healthcare, reproduction, immigration, security, racialization, risk management, emotional wellbeing, property and the common: There is no aspect of embodied existence that has not been affected, if not created (or at least grasped), by biopolitics. Nevertheless, the concept of biopolitics itself, introduced into the critical lexicon by Foucault and still subject to revision and working-through, remains far from settled. Accordingly, students in this seminar will read foundational texts of the burgeoning biopolitical canon — texts by Foucault, Arendt, Agamben, Esposito, Hardt and Negri, to name but a few — as a way of understanding biopolitics not as the basis for a new epistemology but as the term we accord a set of predicaments that emerge at the point where politics and life intercept one another. To facilitate that understanding, students will rely on the texts collected in Biopolitics: A Reader, supplemented by Esposito’s Terms of the Political and Melinda Cooper’s Life as Surplus. For their final paper, students will have the option of writing either an essay assessing the treatment of a biopolitical predicament across a range of texts or a biopolitical case study.",

We will also interrogate how appeals to cruelty underwrite various rights discourses, including debates on the death penalty, human and animal rights, and various international treatises that put a limit on the violence of war. Authors will include: Marquis de Sade, Antonin Artaud, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari.

    "description": "The purpose of this course is to describe and examine the manifold ways that environmental alterations have occurred - over both geologic and historical timescales. Considerable research over the past several decades has shown that anthropogenic disturbance has significantly modified natural processes frequently leading to degraded conditions. The goal of the course is first to establish that shifts in climate, vegetation, and landscapes are \"natural\" and have occurred over geologic time and that the timing and magnitude of these shifts provides the necessary background to evaluate the type, magnitude, and frequency of anthropogenic disturbance. The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change. In the last part of the class, we will focus on how global environmental changes generate impacts at the local scale, and how small-scale transformations propagate into large-scale global environmental issues.",

The last decade has seen the unprecedented increase of the use of targeted killing as the US has expanded its drone strike operations around the globe, and events such as those in Ferguson and Charlottesville have led police brutality and racialized violence to remerge as national concerns. The aim of this course is to study the problem of violence through a geographic lens. it explores a range of topics relating to violence at three scales: the global, the national, and the body. The goal is to interrogate how each scale of unit of analysis reveals different ways of understanding violence and to draw connections between them; and the course will focus particular attention on the historical and political geographies of Western violence. Topics include drone warfare, humanitarian intervention and peacekeeping, police, fascism, the ethics of killing, slavery, colonialism, and the politics of nonviolence.",

The goal of the course is first to establish that shifts in climate, vegetation, and landscapes are \"natural\" and have occurred over geologic time and that the timing and magnitude of these shifts provides the necessary background to evaluate the type, magnitude, and frequency of anthropogenic disturbance. The second, and major theme is to present and examine the types of human-induced changes in biotic, atmospheric, and terrestrial conditions (e.g. logging, grazing, urbanization), and to evaluate the social and management issues resulting from these anthropogenic disturbances. Lastly, the third part of the course will focus on the human dimensions of global change by exploring the social aspects of environmental change. In the last part of the class, we will focus on how global environmental changes generate impacts at the local scale, and how small-scale transformations propagate into large-scale global environmental issues.",

Second, we will situate these works within a broader cultural context, reading them alongside literary texts that Freud explicitly addresses and alongside literary, filmic, and theoretical works that draw on psychoanalytic concepts. Our discussions of the cultural imprint of Freudian thought will encompass a variety of themes, from gender and sexuality to Jewishness to the clinical techniques central to psychoanalytic practice.

We will situate each theme in its historical and literary context and investigate in what ways imagining sexual desires beyond the publicly acceptable may be read 1) as a call for non-conformism and rebellion against the repressive politics of the state exacted on the individual subject, 2) as a response against the psycho-medical field’s narrow labeling of sexual desires as degenerate perversions of middle class morals, 3) as cautionary tales that aim to redress such perceived acts of deviance and reestablish the moral order of the majority and 3) as artistic expression of that which is fundamentally human, i.e. the wide range of human sensory perception between the self and the other, which leads to such desires. The fictional material will be supplemented by medical, legal and political texts that seek to classify, regulate and fight for the expression of sexual relationships that are considered “beyond the norm.”",

The course will then employ these concepts to develop several quantitative approaches to political analysis.

One goal of the course is to familiarize students with foundational thinkers who gave us the discipline of economics: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Mill, and Spencer.

    "description": "Since John F. Kennedy’s 1961 executive order to implement affirmative action policies, institutions of higher education have looked for ways to encourage minority and low-income students to matriculate. Some institutions, such as such as Harvard, UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and UMichigan, have experienced lawsuits against the policy’s implementation. As universities stress their desire for diverse, well-rounded, high achieving classes and continue to implement methods to attract highly qualified students, there is disagreement about which methods are both effective and fair. How can educational administrators, parents and community members work together to improve college access and increase equality? Do we still need to “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are…treated…without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\" or has affirmative action outlived its original purpose? Has the college access gap widened or shrunk? Are students’ experiences on campus living up to the goal of equal opportunity? This course will explore the topic of affirmative action through some traditional classroom techniques (reading/ writing/ discussion) as well as experiential education techniques (such as creating a public policy portfolio project, having conversations with professionals who administer affirmative action at colleges and universities, and pitching proposals to a panel of policy experts).\n\\fThe central work of the course involves creating a portfolio of venues to explore, design, publicize, and promote an affirmative action or anti-discrimination policy/program. Completing the course readings and discussions will develop the skills necessary to complete the portfolio. Throughout the course, students will work in small groups to develop a policy campaign using techniques from writing to video to speeches. This course design attempts to raise students’ awareness of the multiple communication modes for making a compelling and persuasive policy proposal. To create their portfolios, students must advance an issue, demonstrate the techniques they have used to study and develop it, and effectively persuade their audience of the policy/program’s value. Student groups will meet with the professors biweekly or more frequently (as needed) to stay on track and to get help with process and resources.",

We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior exploring the impact, importance and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the “Arab Spring” and its aftermath.

Before every dictator is a population that is willing to accept rule by the dictator. The dictator cannot impose his will on a people that shun a dictatorship. Extrapolating from this concept, we can consider dictatorship to be a syndrome.

The most recent financial crisis has put into question many of the assertions on both sides of this debate, in ways that question the very basic assumptions analysts of the global economy have been making since the creation of the Bretton Woods system in the aftermath of World War II. In this course we investigate the impact of the economic boom of the last two decades, the current crisis, and their impact on the economic fate and standing of particularly the United States, India, China, and Russia. We focus in part on efforts to create a new financial architecture for the global economy, and investigate how the debate between markets and state intervention has been affected by the ongoing financial crisis-and what this may mean for both countries that rely extensively on markets, and for those that strategically promote state intervention.",

The central theme of the course is to evaluate the development of political institutions in Latin America and the challenges currently confronting democracy in the region. We examine the conditions under which Latin American republics gained independence in the 19th Century, and their trajectories of political and economic development. We then consider a range of political challenges confronting Latin American countries, including corruption and criminal violence, human rights abuses past and present, and revolutionary and populist challenges to state authority.",

Throughout the region women have organized around myriad issues, including the right to vote, human rights, poverty, legal rights, anticommunism, the workplace, race, ethnicity and war. Women’s efforts to challenge fiercely repressive regimes, deeply entrenched norms of machismo and extreme poverty defy conventional stereotypes about women and provide us with inspiring examples of how to sustain hope during difficult times. The seminar will introduce students to recent scholarship on women’s movements in Latin America in the 20th century and seek to understand the emergence, evolution and outcomes of women’s movements in particular countries and cross-nationally.",

We also look at how countries manage the environmental and human consequences of industrialization. We look at how great powers succeed or fail at developing and deploying effective military power.

We will also see how the combination of these foreign policies, especially their regional dimension, led the Middle East into the chaos it suffers from now. Given the rapid pace of change in the Middle East, we will combine recent texts and older ones, in order to familiarize ourselves with both the “baseline” of foreign policymaking in the Middle East and its most recent manifestations.

North Korea poses a growing nuclear threat and an ongoing risk of political instability.

Territorial disputes threaten regional instability and dangerous escalation. This course has three goals: (1) to introduce students to salient issues in East Asian international politics; (2) to situate current events within a historical context, and (3) to provide students with analytic tools to analyze contemporary issues. We begin with an examination of the regional balance of power: what is power, who has it, and how is the balance of power shifting? We then focus on the military relations between key countries, assessing the conventional and nuclear balance of power, and the prospects for stable deterrence. We next move to the realm of ideas, where we explore how history and national identities affect the security strategies of states, and how they affect regional relations. We will then consider the prospects for a “liberal peace” in the region, made possible through increasing economic interdependence and through democratization.

Are the United States and China doomed for superpower confrontation, or can China’s rise be accommodated? Next, we explore rising China’s relations and disputes with its neighbors. This course has two primary goals: (1) to familiarize students with the international strategic issues that are salient to China’s rise (in East Asia, and in U.S.-China relations); and (2) to provide students with analytic tools (theories and military analysis) useful to the study of East Asian international security relations.",

What explains this variation, and what difference does ratification make? The course will examine broader questions about American politics by looking through the lens of efforts to ratify these treaties and interact with the UN. We will examine the history of human rights within the UN, the development of the treaties, and US efforts to ratify them.

Scholars and practitioners debate how much of an “order” it actually is or ever was, how “liberal” it is or ever was, and how “global” it is or ever was. But there is widespread consensus that it has reached an inflection point — that the system will look different twenty years from now than it does today. This course will examine the debates over what that future will and should look like, and in particular what steps need to be taken to improve the international order’s capacity with respect to its three core functions: (1) to manage disputes and reduce violent conflict, (2) to mobilize action to address shared challenges like climate change, and (3) to establish rules of the road that govern interstate and transnational conduct in key areas, from trade to nuclear proliferation. To this end, we will look at changes in the distribution of power between states (including the rise of China), the diffusion of power beyond states (including the role of technology), and the crisis of governance within states (including the rise of populism and nationalism).

Instead, the seminar offers a curated view of some of the core works in the field as well as emerging research areas. Particular attention is paid to recent scholarship (mostly within the past five years) to identify conceptual, theoretical, or empirical gaps in existing studies that might inspire your own research efforts. The course is deliberately interdisciplinary: we draw on political science, behavioral economics, social psychology, history, and anthropology, along with some research in natural sciences. It also bridges the disciplinary divide separating comparative politics and international relations by drawing on both civil and interstate wars, as well as violence at lower levels of intensity and scale. Selected readings also span multiple levels of analysis, ranging from sweeping cross-national comparisons across hundreds of years of history to subnational within-country comparisons to organizational and individual-level approaches. Equal weight is given to theory and research design when discussing these readings.\n\\f",

Or true friendship between peoples? We shall be reading classic and contemporary authors about the nature of war and peace. We conclude by considering arguments for non-violence in the thought of Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Can non-violent resistance prevent wars?",

(5) How can it be learned and protected in our everyday lives and in academic, professional and political institutions?\nWe will investigate these questions in several important domains of life—friendship, education, work, medicine, law, and politics.  We will look at classical and modern theories in philosophy and psychology about what practical wisdom is and how it is learned, and undermined.  Throughout the course, we will be contrasting decision-making that depends on practical wisdom, or judgment, with decision making that depends on rule-following and incentives.",

Never has the public sphere been so challenged, so weakened, so undermined by the logic of an all-encompassing economic rationale that has evolved from the abstraction of economic theory and its vision of unimaginable profits to the reality of dilapidated world economies and bankrupt social welfare systems. Given this blindness, it comes as no surprise that we would be living in times that do not pay enough attention to the humanities or to the aesthetic realm for they seem too \"removed\" from the day to day facts of \"reality.\" But let's think again. Who bears witness to the suffering and inequalities around us, to the walls that have been relentlessly erected to keep us all in place? Writers, filmmakers, documentarians, photographers, poets, individuals, who make \"energy\" (intellectual energy) usable in different places and contexts (Hutcheon). This course will cross disciplinary boundaries and follow the \"comparative method\" scrupulously. We will be reading literature with care and learning how to read literarily—with intensive textual scrutiny, defiance, and metatheoretical awareness (Saussy)—a wide array of theoretical and filmic texts. Our goal will be to travel from the theoretical to the particular and vice-versa, from the literary and filmic stories to the suprapersonal, to the wider polity and back to the personal, for these texts share a passion for change through recognizing our shared vulnerability and humanity. With varying degrees of insight, these texts bear witness to how the experience of crisis and regeneration is also a gendered one.",

    "description": "While scholars have examined various aspects of Jewish-Christian relations, and the relations of both Christians and Jews with Muslims during the Middle Ages, the tendency has been to focus on Western Europe, or only on the Middle East and Byzantium. Yet both Jews and Christians of various kinds moved along the trade routes over land and sea throughout Asia and parts of Africa. There they traded, settled, studied, interacted with one another and other religious groups, and they invented new understandings of what it meant to be Jewish or Christian, and how these two identities might intertwine. In Asia and Africa Jews and Christians often found themselves on equal footing with one another, as minorities under Islamic, Mongol or Confucian, or Hindu rule. At other times, Jews had polities and territories of their own, for example in Khazaria or Ethiopia, with which neighboring Christian and Muslim rulers had to deal. In other instances, Jews were under Christian rule, but under Christians, for example, medieval Georgians, with a rather different history and polemical tradition than in Byzantium or the West. In this course, we will focus on Jewish-Christian relations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, West, Central, South, and East Asia, and in Africa, especially Ethiopia. Students will learn of Jewish and Christian travel and settlement in these lands, and the different expressions of Judaism and Christianity there, and forms of interaction between communities. We will also examine the imaginings, polemic, and stories that these communities developed about one another and which developed between these communities, and how these also travelled and changed with new cultural milieus, for example, how Byzantine anti-Jewish stories were transformed when they were retold in Armenia or Ethiopia. Other religious communities will be taken into account as context for these interactions, but will not be the main focus of the class.",

In this course we will examine the main events connected with the Second World War, the genocide of European Jewry and Roma-Sinti, forced resettlements of various populations, and the Allied attacks on the German civilian population.  We will analyze the different stages of coming to grips with that past on the part of German and some other postwar societies, by examining together a number of controversies like those surrounding the Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Eichmann and Barbie trials, the campaign to build a Holocaust memorial in Berlin, Neonazism, the Wehrmacht photo exhibition, and the current campaign to remember German civilian casualties and losses.  Approaching our topic with interdisciplinary and comparative methodology, that is, by utilizing history, journalism, video testimony, music, literature, and art, including film, photography and architecture, students will develop their own perspectives on the formation of postwar German identity and why Nazis remain the epitome of evil. An individual midterm project will allow students to practice the skill of summarizing different sides of a debate, and a final group project will invite students to solidify what they have learned in the course about the formation of national identity by creatively staging a contemporary debate about the Nazi past.",

Covering more than a two hundred year stretch, we will move across an expansive geography encompassing North Africa, the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Central Asia. Throughout this journey, particular attention will be paid to five important themes: imperialism, modernization, nationalism, Islam, and revolution. In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region’s dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior to exploring the impact, importance, and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America’s presence in the Middle East, and the \"Arab Spring” and its aftermath. Whenever possible, we will strive to illuminate ordinary people, as opposed to only elite actors, who contributed to the making of the modern Middle East.",

This seminar builds upon these long overdue efforts by critically engaging the writings of historians, anthropologists, ethnomusicologists, and media experts with the aim of uncovering how the study of sound may radically enrich our understanding of the modern Middle East. Beginning with an overview of sound studies, we will consider where multi-sensory scholarship on North Africa, the Levant, and the Gulf fits into this burgeoning field of inquiry. After situating the Middle East within a body of literature that is at once innovative and highly interdisciplinary, we will then shift to exploring several key themes, including religion, popular culture, mass media, gender, space, and the environment, in relation to the region’s soundscapes. We will listen to audiocassette sermons in Egypt, jazz in Istanbul, and the din of warfare in Iraq, among many other acoustic items, to gain a greater appreciation for the centrality of sound in people’s everyday lives and its significance in the domain of Middle Eastern studies.",

    "description": "“Preserving the Past” will explore the theoretical implications, practical applications, and literary dimensions of oral history.  Through reading and discussion, students will be exposed to a variety of oral histories and evaluate the uses of individual and/or collective memory as a means of documenting, understanding, and appreciating the past. Oral history will be examined as a literary genre with consideration of how the oral historian becomes a creative writer whose work relies almost wholly on the voices of those interviewed. The special demands of oral biography will be considered as well.\nIssues to be addressed include: the place of oral history—by nature personal and subjective—in the larger historical framework; changes demanded by a shift in medium as the oral historian transfers taped commentary to print; the role of the oral historian/oral biographer as re-caster and re-arranger of memory; evolving recording technologies and the impact of the medium on oral history’s “message” and “massage.”\nSelected oral histories (see Required Reading) will be contrasted with and compared to traditional historical accounts of similar events, as well as to one another as regards purpose, methodology, style, and literary effectiveness. Additionally students can consult historical works (see Recommended Reading) for insights into the ways in which oral history has been included. The roles and responsibilities of the practitioner as interviewer, archivist, historian, biographer, and artist will be examined and critiqued.        \nThe Course  agenda will hone students skills in interviewing, listening, transcribing, editing and organizing – moving from the spoken word to a final polished oral history work.    \nEach student will produce an oral history project comprised of 6-12 voices on a cultural, institutional, local, familial, personal, or event-based topic. Ongoing guidance will be available through one-on-one meetings  as the student goes through the process of selecting a theme and individuals to interview, preparing for and conducting interviews, transcribing and editing tapes, and fashioning from them the final work. Through discussing their projects in the Workshop component of the course, students will have the opportunity to network and benefit from feedback.\nRequirements\n\n    Timely and thorough readings of assigned works to be reflected in informed participation in class discussions. (Books must be on hand for the sessions they are to be discussed.)\n    Participation in a Collateral Readers’ Panel based on in-depth reading/viewing of a portion of a traditional historical work/documentary that deals with one or more of the subjects treated in an assigned oral history. Submission of a satisfactory Oral History Project.\n\nGrades will be based on the quality of work in all of the above.

Whether your idea is \"commercial,\" \"artistic,\" or \"personal\" will not matter in terms of the focus of this course, but we will be concerned with your producing something that will hold up to professional scrutiny. We will emphasize the following: 1) a comprehensible story with a beginning, middle and end 2) a sympathetic protagonist 3) a worthy antagonist 4) an appropriate \"love-interest\" (if any), 5) how to keep your story a \"page turner,\" so the reader will want to keep going; 6) proper format and length (100-120 pages) and absence of typos, 7) and originality of premise and dialogue.  Since you will be expected to write an entire first draft of a feature script within this course, it behooves you to be somewhat prepared. It would help if you have a story in mind, a protagonist, a worthy antagonist, a love-interest (if appropriate), and at least an idea of your beginning, middle and end.

Taking care to avoid both teleological presumptions and technological fetishism, we begin with a historical review of the economic processes most often identified as “globalization,\" and ponder the implications of research that shows globalization has a long history and that it has been reversible.  Then we spend the rest of the term critically examining the relationships between global economic integration and changes in international politics and law, as well as the emergence of diverse transnational, national, and sub-national movements opposed to the dominant ideas and practices of economic and political globalization.

Each requires its own approach to structure and storytelling.\n\nWhether it’s memoir, biography, history, science or researched journalism, all non-fiction tells a story, and stories are most effective when readers find them compelling. But where does a story begin? How does it unfold? These are very important factors in building an enthralling narrative. Some successful non-fiction writers tell stories in a purely linear, chronological fashion, while start at the end or the middle or a seminal moment in between. Where to start is just the beginning - the chosen structure for telling the story runs through the entire work, which might interweave multiple topics, told from different perspectives, unfolding in different order.\n\nThese choices also depend upon the platform for publication. Traditional newspaper journalism relies heavily upon a Who/Where/What/When/Why format of immediately laying out the primary information for readers and then delving deeper into details. This comes from the basic assumption that readers have already made the choice to look for information in the particular publication. But new media is more focused on competing for the reader’s attention, and each individual article or work stands alone to a greater degree from its underlying platform, demanding that the writer seek attention through headline, topic and structure. On the other hand, book length projects lend themselves to the largest variety of options and the most elaborate structures, and ultimately succeed or fail based on the way the information is presented as much as on the information itself.\n\nThe class will examine the different outlets for non-fiction publication, print media, online media and books, and the similarities and differences between them, with a focus on the use of structure in all cases. Writing experience is nice, but the only prerequisite is interest in writing. Class time will be devoted to both student and published work, mostly student. Reading will include two full-length books demonstrating different approaches to the use and importance of structure, as well as numerous short and long form printed and online periodical articles more akin in length to the work students will produce. Assigned writings will be a series of short (2-6 page) non-fiction pieces/essays/articles in styles varying weekly, spanning multiple topics and platforms, such as memoir, history, personality profile, and event/subject profile written for print and/or online. In each case the focus will be more on the decision of how to structure the narrative to most effectively tell the story for the chosen audience and platform than on the research and topic itself. All participants will be required to read each other’s work and discuss and critique the effectiveness of the chosen structures as well as the reading assignments weekly.",

The course will seek to come to terms with the Frankfurt School’s understanding of mass culture in urban modernity; its insights into the nature of perception under the conditions of new media; its reflections on religion, art, and the politics of fascism; and its contributions to modernist cultural forms, from montage techniques to the thought-image. We will practice central methods of cultural studies and intellectual history by situating cultural material in its historical context, assessing and evaluating theoretical interventions, and analyzing the medial and generic qualities of aesthetic forms.

The 1970s has been defined by the “oil crisis” that had Americans lined up for gas, the “crisis of confidence” diagnosed by President Jimmy Carter, and the “crisis” of narcissism described as the “Me Decade.” Until recently the 1970s was dismissed with embarrassed references to defeat and self-indulgence. Yet it was the decade in which far-reaching and threatening economic shifts became evident and changes prompted by the political rebellions and social upheavals of the 1960s took hold in unexpected ways. The New Right sharpened the cultural critique and grassroots strategies that would yield Ronald Reagan’s major conservative victories in the 1980s and cement neoliberal governing assumptions. Left activists’ attempts to institutionalize the gains of feminism, black power, and gay liberation that would continue to provoke challenges into the 1990s, when Bill Clinton’s “third way” campaign stood as a referendum on the policies of the past. Drawing on primary sources, historical analyses, and cultural criticism, this course explores three decades of Americans’ engagement with globalization, social inequality, and cultural contestation.",

Conversely, it will also include feminism’s work on racism by addressing the issue of women’s collaboration in white supremacy discourse, both in the US and racist Nazi Germany.

    "description": "What are the main sources of social order in an increasingly global world (dis)order? We reside at the far end of vast, rapid and complex processes of social transformation referred to as modernization. These processes include the development of new ways of organizing economies, politics, culture, and society—the fundamental building blocks of human communities. One central issue addressed in this course is the worth or legitimacy of modernity. Which of the institutions and ideas that structured and guided processes of modernization are worth defending or reforming? Which should be rejected? Or should we reject them all and instead embrace a new, post-modern political epoch? To approach these questions we will focus on the market economy, the nation state, discipline and discourse, and we will read from the giants of modern social theory: Smith, Marx and Weber, Tocqueville and Mill, Foucault and Habermas. Processes of modernization also draw more and more persons and societies into the net of interconnectiv­ity, mobility, and hybridity that we refer to as globalization. Understanding modernity as inherently global, originally imperial, and now increasingly post-colonial raises a further set of issues. Once we are attentive to the roles played by colonial domination and racial exploitation in generating modern social orders, does this fundamentally alter our verdict on these processes? What are implications of the fact that many of the tools of resistance to Western imperialism and domination seem to have been forged in the process of modernization itself? Does the Eurocentrism of the tradition of modern social theory invalidate its central concepts and insights? Or can they be reformulated in a way that divorces their critical power from the prejudices that informed their elaboration? Are ‘Europeans’ increasingly ‘provincialized’ as Western political, social and epistemic hegemony declines in an ever-more global world? This course tackles these issues in tandem. It pairs some of the most important modern social theorists with some of their most trenchant global and post-colonial critics, exploring several dimensions of the interchange between ‘the West and the rest’ and in the process throwing into sharp focus the question of the legitimacy of global modernity.",

    "description": "Globalization has eroded local traditions, economies, and sources of authority. Yet, in in spite of – or perhaps because of this – the local has retained both its allure and potency as a discourse of social, cultural, and political resistance to globalization. Adages such as “all politics is local” and “think globally, act locally” reflect commonly touted assumptions of the enduring significance of the local.\nThis course draws on theoretical texts, documentary film, history, and cultural studies to analyze articulations of the local in a range of responses to globalization. Early readings will establish the contours of globalization and prompt students to pose broad questions about what theorists call the “production of locality.” We’ll explore these questions with close readings around four themes, including media, civil society, food, and labor. We’ll read work by Antonio Negri, David Harvey, and Saskia Sassen, among others. Topics covered will range from the 1994 Zapatista uprising in Mexico and its influence on other resistance movements to expressions of “gastronationalism” and the politics of local food consumption.\nStudents will write a brief 5-page essay responding to the readings, a 7-10 page review essay, and a 12-15-page research paper, on which they’ll base a class presentation. Students will be required to purchase several texts, but the majority of readings will be available on Blackboard.",

    "description": "Narratives about the emergence of European modernity often link the rise of the modern nation state and the triumph of Enlightenment rationality with the decline of religion in a process of secularization. With an increasing separation of religion and politics, the story goes, religion is relegated to the private sphere while a civic politics occupies the public sphere. A globalized world characterized by networks of communication and cultural exchange might appear, then, as the epitome of a cosmopolitan capitalism and its secular ethos. \nIn the last two decades, however, this narrative of secularization has been called into question in the midst of a “return of religion” in a “post-secular society.” Scholarship on political theology, meanwhile, has shown how modern politics and its concept of sovereign power adopt and appropriate religious forms of thought in their secular institutions. Instead of secularization as the decline of religion, critics are rethinking secularization in terms of a hidden afterlife of religion in a secular modernity that is unable to cast aside its theological roots.\nThe course will examine how the return of religion and political theology are transforming politics in a globalized and post-national European modernity. In what ways might religion undergird the call for a “radical Enlightenment” that exceeds national boundaries? How might a post-secular society entertain a dialogue of religion and the secular through mutual translation? How might religion provide a basis not only for the theory of sovereign power but for forms of resistance in which the public sphere is contested? \nWe will tackle these questions through readings of classical texts (Luther, Hobbes, Spinoza, Kant, Schmitt) alongside the work of twentieth-century and contemporary German, French, and Anglo-American critics (de Vries, Casanova, Hardt and Negri, Arendt, Lefort, Foucault, Said, Löwith, Blumenberg, Habermas, Taylor, Asad).",

Thus, it will critically address and theorize the more recent tendency to shift and cross normative borders in a way that runs counter to the constraints implied in traditional models of gender and race. In terms of gender, it will emphasize the contemporary fluidity of concepts of masculinity and femininity, deconstruction of hierarchical gender models, as well as the growing debate around transgender issues in texts, among others, by Judith Butler. In terms of race, it will address the paradigm’s contested definitions and boundaries, and the current debate on its social implications. It will discuss the issues of exclusion and inclusion, the third space, post-colonialism and the ideology and policy of race/racism by focusing, among others, on creative non/fictional narratives as well as theoretical texts by Frantz Fanon and W.E. DuBois. As a third angle on questioning borders, it will explore the aspect of the human - both in and beyond its relation to race, gender, and the concurrent effect of dehumanization - in texts by Hannah Arendt, Giorgio Agamben and Jacques Derrida on human and civil rights, crimes against humanity, sovereign power vs. bare life, and man in relation to animal.",

    "description": "The prison has become a central institution of American society; more than two million people are currently held in federal prisons, state prisons, juvenile correctional facilities, local jails, military prisons, and detention facilities at home and in US territories abroad. In fact, US incarceration rates are the highest worldwide. Whereas in the 19th century the American prison was often considered a ‘modern’ institution of reform (replacing corporal punishment) which was visited and inspected by European visitors such as Alexis de Tocqueville and Charles Dickens, it has become the object of grave humanitarian concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries. Terms such as “carceral state” and “prison industrial complex” (referring to profit-oriented multinational corporations in the prison sector) figure prominently in recent critical interventions. We will briefly review the history of the US prison system in the first part of the seminar.\nFor those on the outside, the prison population is often rendered invisible and voiceless. And yet, from its beginnings, American literary and cultural production abounds with experiences of captivity, bondage, and imprisonment. H. Bruce Franklin, for instance, has remarked on the African American literary tradition as being rooted in the experience of imprisonment and slavery, and obviously race and racialization continue to be crucial aspects in view of a prison population that is largely non-white. Of course, other markers of difference such as gender, class, religion, and sexual orientation also have to be taken into account. In response to the dramatic increase in imprisonment rates over the last decades, prison abolitionism has formed and become a major social and political movement to protest mass incarceration as the “New Jim Crow” (Michelle Alexander, Angela Davis). In the second part of this seminar we will focus on prison writing in various forms (including texts, films, and television series) and on the theoretical approaches that have emerged in the field of critical prison studies to adequately address the nexus of violence, (state) power, and punishment.\nRequired reading includes texts by Michel Foucault, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., Leonard Peltier, Hisaye Yamamoto as well as Angela Davis, Are Prisons Obsolete?(2003), Stewart O’Nan, The Good Wife (2005), and Piper Kerman, Orange is the New Black (2015).

    "description": "In 2000, political philosophers Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri published “Empire,” a work that argued that we have moved from imperialism to Empire, defined as a shift from sovereign to networked rule, from British to American world dominance. If imperialism was a juridical construction extending from the metropole to the colony; Empire, Hardt and Negri argued, is characterized by the boundary-less power of law.\nThis course on “Empire and Law” is about studying and assessing Hardt and Negri’s history and claims. In so doing, we examine what legal anthropologists have labeled the passage of law and colonialism to that of law and globalization, with a focus upon the British Empire and American power at the close of the twentieth-century. By concentrating upon law and colonialism and law and globalization as fields structuring the global economy since the 19th century, moreover, this course emphasizes and compares the manifold constitutive powers of law in economy and society as well as how scholars in both fields have approached its study. How did law shape colonial empire and what is the role of law under globalization? Did Hardt and Negri fully characterize or over-state the differences in legal rule across empires? Have events since 2000, such as 9/11, the Iraq War, and the election of Donald Trump re-configured Empire and its laws?",

    "description": "Globalization and the pursuit of market-led development have become two crucial concepts that re-emerged full-blown in the wake of the Cold War, as the West triumphed over the Soviet Union and the Marxist model.    With the United States as the sole remaining super power, liberal democracy and market-led economies were widely considered by policy makers in the West to be the inevitable cornerstone of a new global order.   Yet, the process of globalization since the early 1990s has produced unpredicted results.    The end of the Cold War has not generated a prolonged \"Pax Americana\" marked by an end to intra-state warfare, insurgencies, or violence, nor has economic development resulted in the consolidation of democracy.  The strongest economic performer in the post Cold War period has been China, still an authoritarian Marxist regime, and the Russian Federation that emerged from the former USSR is evolving in a decidedly anti-democratic direction. \nThe end of the Cold War in the Americas appeared to usher in the potential for greater hemispheric unity, the strengthening of representative democracy and sustained economic growth.  While economic development has been historically strong, it remains uneven and the fruits of economic success often distributed in a skewed pattern favoring elite groups.    In several countries in the region, a strong reaction to liberal democracy and market-led economic growth gave rise to the consolidation of proto-authoritarian regimes such as that of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela promoting a 21st century brand of revolution and a revival of anti-U.S. sentiment. Countries in the region still contend with problems such as insurgency, organized crime, and high levels of violence.  \nThis course will examine the links between democracy, market-led development, and globalization in greater theoretical depth as well as in practice since the end of the Cold War.  It will use Latin America as a particular point of focus in highlighting macro trends in politics and economic policy-making since the 1990s as well as case studies digging deeper into these variables.\nThe first part of the course focuses on globalization in general, its impact on the world economy and the economies of specific countries and on international business.  The tension between globalization and moral questions will be elaborated on.  Intellectual/ideological responses to globalization will also be discussed.\nThe second part of the course will trace trends in Latin America's links to the global economy and the relationship between paths of economic development and political structures.  Specific attention will be paid to the transition from military dictatorships to civilian democracies, the challenge of illegally armed groups and criminal organizations to stability in the region, and the current bifurcated development path between countries pursuing market-oriented growth policies and those engaged in inward-led growth and resource nationalism.",

Originating in the Hebrew Bible as prophesy of the Jewish “dispersion in all kingdoms of the earth,” contemporary uses of the term have accrued meaning in a variety of contexts and disciplines to designate \"the movement, migration, or scattering of people away from an established or ancestral homeland.” Considering mass-migration, exile, and expulsion in all sectors of the world, this seminar will focus on a variety of concepts and theories related to diaspora. Studying a range of ethnographic, historical, theoretical, and literary texts, we will compare Jewish, African, and Asian diasporas in the context of historical, cultural and territorial characteristics.

    "description": "This course provides students the opportunity to study, discuss, and write about global media and the transformation of cultures and relations between peoples since the 1980s. Although most historians argue that globalization is an old process that began with the establishment of inter-regional trade many centuries ago, they also agree with other social scientists who see this most recent phase of globalization as qualitatively different from earlier stages of the process.  Indeed it seems fair to say that what most people today mean when they use the word “globalization” would not exist without the new global media.   \n\nPerhaps the most important features of recent globalization are the continuous development of new media (especially the internet and social media) and the rapid global diffusion of those media.   In this course students will study these subjects and how they are involved in ongoing changes in everyday life, social relations, high and popular cultures, and the practice of politics all around the world.  Seminar meetings for most of the term will consist primarily of discussion of readings, films, and videos assigned to all students, and at the end of the term discussion the particular research projects done by each student. \n\nSEMINAR REQUIREMENTS\nThis is not a lecture course.  To be successful, all members of the seminar have to participate in discussions of course materials.  Students are required to finish assigned readings and videos as preparation for in-class discussions.  Readings include several required books, as well as articles that are available online. Videos include documentary and feature films on reserve at the Jones Media Center.  Participation in the seminar’s discussions will count for 25% of the final grade.\n\nStudents will be required to write a series of three related papers focused on global media in a particular country.  Students with good second language skills are encouraged to select a country in which English is not the native tongue.  Having each student focus the independent component of their work in the course on media developments and culture in a particular country will enable the whole seminar to construct a unique global understanding of our subject that is grounded in many details drawn from many parts of the world by the students.  Each student will report first on media development in the country they have chosen in a short factual report.  Their second paper will describe and discuss the ways media in their particular country have covered a global news story of importance (ie. the election of Donald Trump).  The student’s final paper on their particular country will present research on a narrowly defined media subject of special interest to them.",

    "description": "Our social structure is full of unseen, unspoken, and unheard dynamics. These hidden and irresponsible social behaviors have always contributed to the building of visible and invisible social walls. Behind these walls, a growing invisible population has found a way to social visibility through addiction, violence, and crime. This course offers students the unique opportunity to collaborate with a group of people from behind those social walls from two distinct perspectives: theoretical and practical. For one class each week, students will study the root causes of social isolation and invisibility mainly pertaining to incarceration and addiction, in an active learning classroom. For the other half, students will travel to Sullivan County Department of Corrections, in Unity, NH and participate in an interdisciplinary arts program for inmates there. Its final goal is the creation and performance of an original production on the theme of the inmates’ voices. The final project for the course will combine research on themes related to incarceration, rehabilitation, transition, facilitation with critical analysis and self-reflection on the effectiveness of community-based learning and performance in rehabilitation.",

    "description": "In 1948, the UN drafted its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In it, Article 25 states  that “Everyone has the right to...food...and medical care.” But today almost 800 million people globally – one in about 8 human beings -- remain trapped in extreme hunger and poverty. Despite major strides during the past decade, hunger and poverty remain with us. This course will detail the plight of the so-called “bottom billion” people who are living on less than US$1.25 a day. But it will also examine a second billion, who face chronic hunger and disease in both developing and developed countries. In the United States, for example, some 45 million people – about one in 7 Americans – suffer “chronic food insecurity”. More than half of them are children; 8 percent are elderly.\nDespite the good intentions of the Universal Declaration and the more recent Millennium Goals, we have failed to achieve “health and well-being . . . including food, clothing, housing and medical care . . . .” for the world’s people. The Declaration remains today a promise diluted, its basic premise and hope unfulfilled. As its core catalytic question, therefore, this course asks: Why?\nThe instructors and students will use didactic presentations, case study methodology, briefing papers and other analytical tools to interrogate two broad components:\n• The first will define and analyze the hunger, health and poverty problems, and the efforts to resolve them. We will present, discuss and use the major documents (U.N., U.S. Census, etc) along with the theories of Thomas Malthus and Amartya Sen. The course will engage the training of its two instructors and juxtapose the social science of poverty and hunger with the biology of chronic undernutrition and the subsequent increased susceptibility to otherwise preventable or treatable infectious diseases responsible for most of the preventable health problems and deaths among the bottom two billion people.\n• The course’s second component will focus on workable solutions. If poverty is the cause of chronic hunger and poor health, how might this be resolved? Were the Millennium Goals focused on the wrong solutions? What is working and what is not?\nDr.  Jim Yung Kim, until recently head of Dartmouth College and now the 12th president of the World Bank, has often said that the response to hunger, poverty and lack of health care will define “the moral standing” of his generation. This course will focus on the defining edge of that moral response, and participants will be expected to identify and address its details.",

    "description": "Early modern philosophical regimes of knowledge in Europe tend to revolve around two major senses: that of sight, and that of touch. For seventeenth-century French philosopher, René Descartes, for example, perception relies on the ability of the human eye to serve as a direct link between the exterior world and the interior subject (the soul). The desire to understand the ways in which the body perceives the senses and translates them into a basis for memory and knowledge is evident in the art, philosophy, and literature of the day. In this course, we will analyze works of art, literature, and philosophy from the 16th-18th centuries in England, France, Italy, and Germany, asking how aesthetic and materialist theories that emerge and take hold in the early modern period still shape modern understandings of the human and its relation to the world.\nExploring aesthetic reactions and writings on art and literature, we will investigate the idea of sensibility, perception and the senses, visual knowledge, and modes of feeling and knowing through sight and touch. Readings include selections from Diderot, Rousseau, Burke, Hogarth, Alberti, Leonardo, Vasari, Lessing, Jane Austen, Baudelaire, among others.",

    "description": "The subject of this course is practical wisdom, the capacity to make difficult ethical choices. Aristotle called this human capacity phronesis and saw it as essential for doing the right thing in the right way at the right time. Throughout the course, we will be investigating five questions:\n\n    What is practical wisdom?\n    When and why do we need it?\n    How do we learn practical wisdom?\n    What institutional forces threaten practical wisdom?\n    How can institutions be designed to encourage and nurture practical wisdom?\n\nWe will investigate these questions in several important domains in life - friendship, education, work, medicine, and family. Because practical wisdom is learned by reflecting on our own practices and experiences, we will rely heavily on stories about your own experiences that you will write and present in light of the theory and cases we read. Improving our own skills in reflective practice will also be encouraged by the format of the class which will rely on well-informed and thoughtful discussion in a seminar format.\nWe will also investigate these questions more theoretically in an effort to develop a solid understanding of what makes wisdom or judgment a crucial component of our lives. Throughout the course, we will be contrasting decision-making that depends on practical wisdom with decision making that depends on following various kind of rules or responding to external rewards and punishments.\nThis will be an interdisciplinary course with readings drawn from philosophy, ethics, literature, psychology, education, and sociology. Prior knowledge of these fields is not a prerequisite. We will frequently be joined by guests from other departments and from the Medical School.",

    "description": "This course provides practical training experience through a full-time internship at an institution outside of the Dartmouth College campuses (Lebanon and Hanover). The goal of this course is to provide students with real-world, hands-on experience with existing enterprises through internship during graduate school. Such experience will expose students to diverse career opportunities during graduate school, providing students with lead-time to focus and network in a field of interest prior to completion of their PhD. Multiple types of training (e.g., project management and business entrepreneurship skills needed in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, teaching experience needed for a successful faculty position in liberal arts colleges) will be particularly valuable for students who go on to conduct NIH-funded research as well as benefit those students who do not follow the academic research career track. Approximately 30% of biomedical PhDs work in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries in research and non-research positions.\n \nExamples of potential internship opportunities are:\n\n    Researcher in a biotechnology or pharmaceutical company\n    Business and marketing associate in a biotechnology or pharmaceutical company\n    Teacher/lecturer at an institution of higher education/college\n    Assistant at a patent law firm\n    Position in office of government policy and legislation\n    Position in office of public health policy\n\n   For this course, the student will propose and arrange a paid or unpaid internship in an existing enterprise (industry, government, or other) in consultation with their Thesis Advisor (primary mentor), Advisory Committee, and MCB Graduate Committee prior to enrollment.  This process should happen in advance of the term of enrollment. Course enrollment is concurrent with the internship and should be for a period of one term. At the end of the internship, the student will make an oral presentation (with Powerpoint slides; approx. 20 minutes) to the MCB community that addresses the nature of the enterprise they were engaged in, the problem they were assigned, and the results and impact of their project. The purpose of the presentation is to share lessons learned from the internship experience with the MCB community. The presentation will be accompanied by a short but complete written report. Neither the presentation nor report should contain confidential information of the enterprise.\n   The Internship Proposal Form  must be completed prior to committing to an internship, and must be signed by the student’s Thesis Advisor and the Course Director. A letter from the Internship Supervisor at the proposed host enterprise must be sent to the Thesis Advisor and Course Director detailing the start/end dates of the internship, and the job function and roles of the intern.\nPrerequisite: Must have completed all MCB Program and course requirements prior to enrolling.  Senior students in their fourth year or beyond who are still conducting their research and are at least 6 months away from thesis defense will be eligible.  Must have prior approval of Thesis Advisor, Advisory Committee and MCB Graduate Committee for internship.  \nThis course is graded on a credit/no credit basis by the Course Director after completion of the written report and oral presentation. International students with visa sponsorship should consult with the Office of Visa and Immigration Services (OVIS) regarding eligibility, and review the appended information on F-1 Curricular Practical Training.\nFinancial matters:\n   The internship may be paid or unpaid by the host enterprise or by Dartmouth stipend, depending on arrangement with their Thesis Advisor (as in cases where the internship is a collaboration that will benefit the Advisor’s research), but the total student/intern salary cannot exceed the amount that student would have otherwise received as Dartmouth stipend. Internship at another academic institution to perform research is discouraged; the goal of this internship program is to expose students to career environments not found within Dartmouth. The Thesis Advisor cannot serve as or appoint the Internship Supervisor (such as in cases where the proposed internship would be hosted by a local company in which the Thesis Advisor has a stake/role).\n   Dartmouth-based health insurance benefits will be paid by the student’s Thesis Advisor for the term.",

Through weekly readings, students will explore conceptual and historical analysis of sound synthesis with specific attention to the false dichotomy between the “synthetic” and “natural”. Listening assignments focus on historic and contemporary artists who are expanding the listening field to include a vast hybrid of interconnected, varied, and dynamic content. Examples of student projects include creating digital instruments from field recordings, filtering tones with physical objects, building additive and subtractive synths from scratch, and developing digitally dense sonic ecosystems.",

How have they used music to forge links with Africans in other nations and a broader African diaspora? And how have African popular musics, and the musicians themselves, circulated in local and global contexts? In this course, we investigate a range of popular musics from the African continent, focusing in particular on music from Western and Southern Africa. Students will be introduced to diverse genres, from highlife to chimurenga to kwaito, and the methodological approaches of ethnomusicology. Each case study fits into four broad course themes: music and political dissent; music and diaspora; African music and the “World Music” industry; music and youth culture. Texts, performances, media, and in-class workshops all form an integral part of this course.",

    "description": "Since John F. Kennedy’s 1961 executive order to implement affirmative action policies, institutions of higher education have looked for ways to encourage minority and low-income students to matriculate. Some institutions, such as such as Harvard, UC Berkeley, UT Austin, and UMichigan, have experienced lawsuits against the policy’s implementation. As universities stress their desire for diverse, well-rounded, high achieving classes and continue to implement methods to attract highly qualified students, there is disagreement about which methods are both effective and fair. How can educational administrators, parents and community members work together to improve college access and increase equality? Do we still need to “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are…treated…without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\" or has affirmative action outlived its original purpose? Has the college access gap widened or shrunk? Are students’ experiences on campus living up to the goal of equal opportunity? This course will explore the topic of affirmative action through some traditional classroom techniques (reading/ writing/ discussion) as well as experiential education techniques (such as creating a public policy portfolio project, having conversations with professionals who administer affirmative action at colleges and universities, and pitching proposals to a panel of policy experts).\n\\fThe central work of the course involves creating a portfolio of venues to explore, design, publicize, and promote an affirmative action or anti-discrimination policy/program. Completing the course readings and discussions will develop the skills necessary to complete the portfolio. Throughout the course, students will work in small groups to develop a policy campaign using techniques from writing to video to speeches. This course design attempts to raise students’ awareness of the multiple communication modes for making a compelling and persuasive policy proposal. To create their portfolios, students must advance an issue, demonstrate the techniques they have used to study and develop it, and effectively persuade their audience of the policy/program’s value. Student groups will meet with the professors biweekly or more frequently (as needed) to stay on track and to get help with process and resources.",

    "description": "Do heads of state matter when it comes to making foreign policy decisions?  We certainly act as if they do and we vote as if they do.  But it’s also possible that sometimes, structural conditions render leaders irrelevant –that any leader, when faced with the same constraints, could not help but make the same decision.  Any responsible study of foreign policy will pay attention to questions of the conditions under which leaders matter as well as the constraints on foreign policy leadership.  Therefore, in this course, we will study the essence of foreign policy decision-making with a special emphasis on the sorts of decisions that leaders can and do make. As we do so we will be introduced to a number of tools and models to help explain the process of foreign policy decision-making. These tools, concepts, and models will broadly include the political psychology of foreign policy decision-making, the dangers of decision-making during times of great crisis, and the role that various organizations play in foreign policy decisions.",

    "description": "Emotions define human experience. When you ask someone how they are, they tell you how they are feeling. We formulate our life goals in terms of emotions, striving to obtain happiness, while avoiding regret. Emotions such as love, pride, contempt, and shame shape our social relationships, both as individuals and as groups. When our emotions go badly awry, we suffer debilitating mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Although emotions play a central role in our lives, studying them scientifically presents profound challenges. They seem intuitively hidden, elusive, messy, and hard to evoke or quantify in a laboratory. Despite these challenges, researchers have developed a thriving science of our emotional lives, which you will learn about in this course. We will begin by considering the origins of emotion, both biological and cultural. Subsequently we will examine how emotions manifest themselves in our bodies and brains, change dynamically over time, shape our social interactions, influence our cognition, and affect our mental health. Finally, we will consider ongoing theoretical debates in emotion science, and where the field could and should go next.",

Some of those decisions require gradual deliberation while others can be made quickly. Nevertheless, to make any decision we rely on external information and what outcomes we expect from those decisions. Decisions are easy to make if information is complete and the outcomes are certain. But how does the brain combine different sources of partial information to make decisions in the face of uncertain outcomes?  In this course we will examine decision making from both behavioral and neurobiological points of view. Specifically, we will learn about different methods used in psychology, economics, and neuroscience (e.g. operant conditioning, game theory, reinforcement learning, prospect theory, electrophysiology, neuroimaging) to study decision making at various levels, from cognitive processes to underpinning neural activity and mechanisms.",

This course will explore the hypothesis that all these modes of human behavior and cognition share a common root cause in our brains. We will focus in particular on the human capacity to imagine. We can, for example, construct a representation of a thing, say an airplane, or an event, say a planned party, and then go about making real that which we imagined. How is this capacity to imagine and creatively plan realized in the brain? Where did it first appear in the human lineage? What is the relationship of imagining to other important capacities, such as attention, volition, consciousness, planning and executive control?

This course will address this question, which is known as ‘the problem of other minds.’ We will tackle ‘the problem of other minds’ from multiple angles, relying heavily on neuroscience and psychology research, as well as a few foundational papers from philosophy. Specifically, we will address questions such as: Do specialized portions of the brain accomplish mental state inference? When do mind-reading skills develop in children and are humans the only species that can represent other minds? Why do some people, such as individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), experience difficulties in understanding others?

    "description": "Digitization of vast numbers of texts and rapid advances in computational methods are enabling new forms of criticism in all areas of literary study. Classics was an early adopter of digital technologies, and computation is now pervasive throughout the field, as illustrated by flagship projects such as the Perseus Digital Library. Beyond the familiar examples of digitized texts and simple word searches, scholars and students also benefit from an ever-growing array of sophisticated quantitative tools, and from increasing engagement with diverse technical disciplines – natural language processing, data science, even bioinformatics. Through a survey of recent research at the intersection of Latin literature and the digital humanities, this course will introduce you to the state of the art in quantitative literary criticism. To ground our methodological investigations, we will explore a diverse selection of Latin poetry, including epic (Vergil, Lucan, and Catullus), elegy (Catullus), and comedy (Plautus), and sample some less famous later authors, such as Paul the Deacon and Vitalis of Blois, who were influenced by classical antecedents. At each turn, we will examine the interplay between traditional (close reading, philology, theory) and data-driven analyses of Latin literature and consider how quantitative methods can support humanistic inquiry. Along the way, you will gain hands-on experience with powerful computational tools and be introduced to now ubiquitous critical approaches, such as intertextuality and reception studies. Assigned readings will be in English translation using bilingual Latin-English editions; in addition to reading all of the English, students with Latin will be responsible for understanding and translating “micro samples” of the original texts. The course assumes no prior computational background.",

You likely have learned how to answer questions like these with standard OLS (linear) regression techniques and cross-sectional data, which remain useful tools in social scientists’ methodological toolbox. But these techniques are also quite limited, and impose strict assumptions that do not allow us to meet many of our goals, adequately answer our questions, or provide stringent tests of our theories and hypotheses.\n\\fIn this course, we’ll pick up where introductory statistics courses leave off, and get an introduction to more advanced statistical methods for observational data, including but not limited to: regression for categorical dependent variables, fixed and random effects models, and hierarchical linear modeling. This course will be a mix of seminar and lecture, where we will be focused on understanding how we can use these methods to better meet our goals and answer our research questions. Put differently, this course is less focused on going “under the hood” and more focused on “how to drive”—specifically, we will interrogate the assumptions and use of these statistical methods in the social sciences and learn how to implement these methods using STATA. This will include: discussion of core methodological assumptions and limitations, how to apply these statistical methods in different settings, and learning when specific methods are appropriate tools and when they are not. We will explore these issues through student-led discussions, hands-on data analysis, and dissecting the application of these methods in academic journal articles. As part of this course, you will be exposed to (and critique) a wide range of sociological research published in our major disciplinary journals. The course will culminate in an independent research project where students will analyze data and use the one or more of the modeling techniques discussed during the term to answer a sociological research question of their choosing.

Religion is understood to direct the individual to the contemplation of the divine and provide a moral code; sex and sexuality is often perceived as too human and too tied to pleasure to have anything to do with the divine. But if we examine the relationship between sexuality and religion, we find that the two are inextricably intertwined. Indeed, the understanding of humans as sexed beings (that is, with differing sexual identities and as beings who engage in sex) is often grounded in religious texts, practices, and ideologies. Yet that religious grounding, while seemingly so solid, proves surprisingly flexible in practice. We will examine comparatively the ways in which religious stories, beliefs, and practices have shaped across several traditions. In addition to studying the normative ways that religions constructed sex and sexuality, we also examine how communities and individuals have re-interpreted, re-shaped, and refused the boundaries of normative religion.",

    "description": "This course introduces students to the problems and concerns of the study of religion by examining the interaction between economic and religious discourse and practice. Money has long been an object of reflection in philosophical, ethical, and religious traditions. We will explore money as a social phenomenon, a way human communities construct meaning and relationships, deal with power and obligation, and communicate what matters to them. We seek to understand what money is, how it interacts with moral categories like guilt and human value, and how it shapes areas of life such as identity, friendship, love, and sex. We also examine perspectives emerging from religious and ethical traditions concerning the presence of money in modern life. In so doing, we grapple with issues of individual and communal meaning, identity, and value judgment, as well as the challenge of defining what counts as religion—concerns that are integral to the discipline of religious studies and central to humanistic inquiry more broadly.",

    "description": "The biosphere has evolved a level of biodiversity unprecedented in earth history in a period (the last ten thousand years) known as the Holocene in which humans evolved from hunter-gatherers to agrarians and industrialists. Agriculture enabled the development of complex civilizations which had a tendency to press ecological support systems to the point of collapse. The latest of these – industrial capitalism – is now a global civilization and is putting pressure on the planet as a whole to the extent that the evolving and reparative capacities of life on earth are at risk. Despite a groundswell of environmental protest, and regulatory changes, mainstream conservation and climate science has not yet changed the direction of civilization in a more sustainable direction. Some in the conservation movement have joined forces with religious leaders such as Patriarch Bartholomew, and Pope Francis who penned an ‘environmental encyclical’ in 2015, in recognition of the enduring cultural power of religion and of its potential to promote pro-environmental beliefs and behaviors. In this course we will study the book which inspired the formation of the EPA in the United States, a survey of environmental ethics by the ‘founding father’ of the field, a history of ideas perspective on the cultural origins of the environmental crisis and possible faith-based repairs.",

This class explores the idea of social capital and its significance for analyzing culture and society. We first seek to grasp the idea of “capital” as applied to the social and relational world, examining why social theorists have found this a useful lens of analysis. What does it mean to have social and cultural capital? We then explore how and why human communal bonds are formed and whether such interactions might justifiable be called “sacred” or “religious.” We consider gifts and reciprocity as ways we forge human connection, exploring philosophical and anthropological reflection on these practices. We examine changes in how community bonds are formed in light of globalization and new technology. We review concerns about the loss of community and connection, and about the barriers to access and advancement faced by those with less social capital. We also consider religious and ethical reflection on social capital as applied to human and divine beings. Readings include Bourdieu, Durkheim, Grewal, Mauss, Putnam, Sunstein, and Volf.",

We focus on Christianity, most centrally, while considering its relation to Ancient Near Eastern and Greco-Roman religions at specific moments. The course offers students with a basic historical and theoretical framework for thinking about the tensions and possibilities that emerge in the encounter between religious and political thought, institutions, and communities in these periods. This course challenges the assumption that religion and politics are self-evident and clearly distinct realms. Instead, we examine the ways that the boundaries between religion and politics have been continually blurred throughout history and across communities and traditions, and consider how “religion” and “politics” are interdependent and mutually reinforcing categories of thought and practice.",

The unprecedented fusion Dante made of these elements in the Commedia [The Divine Comedy] has guaranteed his great poem a vast public, extending across world cultures and the seven centuries since it initially traveled among elite readers in north-central Italy in the early decades of the fourteenth century. This course will first examine the development of Dante’s poetic voice in La vita nova [The New Life, ca. 1293-94] and then focus on its subsequent expansion into an all-encompassing vision of life and death in Inferno [Hell, ca. 1306-09], the first of the three canticles of the Commedia. Situating Dante in his own time and place will be essential to our analysis of his poetry, but attention to the multiple ways that Dante’s work has been interpreted, translated, and appropriated in other periods, languages, and media will provide a critical framework for understanding its enduring appeal, why – in the words of Italo Calvino – it “has not finished saying what it has to say.” Readings, lectures, discussion, and written work – to include a mid-term exam, two short essays, and a final digital project – will be in English.

The conversion of ‘barbarian’ peoples in northwest Europe between the years 400 and 1000 meant Christianity had to adapt to a different environment than the Roman and Mediterranean one in which the religion developed. The northern world was without the Roman Empire, without cities, with different languages, cultures and notions of relations between the human and divine worlds. This course explores the impact the conversion of Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, and Nordic communities had on Christianity, as well as why communities of the northern world voluntarily chose to adopt this new religion.

How does this differ from how those outside power structures mobilize it? How do uses of religion evolve to accommodate different cultural contexts and new political circumstances?

No serious medieval thinkers would have found that credible. Their moral and intellectual ideals were thoroughly elitist. Nevertheless, some of them were committed to progressive political ideals, which constitute the Enlightenment toward which they worked, often at considerable personal risk. Maimonides' work epitomizes this type of Enlightenment, both in its arguments and in the style of its esotericism. The seminar will strive to achieve a synoptic view of this classic of Western religious-political thought.\"",

    "description": "Daily news reports direct much of our attention to social problems such as crime, poverty, prejudice and political corruption. Yet rarely are such reports accompanied by a discussion of the systematic causes of these problems. More often we become witness to an endless stream of media coverage reporting seemingly isolated incidents. Seldom are we informed of the decision-making process by which some social problems become selected for coverage, while others are ignored. The purpose of this course is to subject the coverage of modern social problems to an in-depth, critical analysis. We will attempt to answer such questions as: \"how does a social problem become defined as such?\" and \"what are the causes or sources of various social problems?\" Open to all classes.",

What does this mean for public policy, population health and aging, fertility and reproductive health, immigration and social inequality? To gain insight into these questions, social scientists study some of life’s most intimate moments – sex, illness and death, and moving from home to home. These components of population change (mortality, fertility, and migration) help us better understand the impact of population composition and change. In this class, we will first learn the basic tools that social scientists use to analyze broad population trends. We will then use these tools to gain insight into population patterns across the globe. At the end of the course, students will apply what they learned to the analysis of the population trends of a country of their choice, as well as compare and contrast population trends across different countries.",

We will test these theories by applying them to specific cases. A major part of the course will focus on the economic 'miracle' of East Asian countries, as well as cases that have not been so successful.

    "description": "Sociologists and other social scientists are often interested in understanding causal and dynamic social processes such as:\n“How do the places we live, work, and play get under the skin and affect health and well-being across the life course?”\n“Does upward social class mobility change one’s political attitudes?”\n“What social currents are responsible for changes in support for same-sex marriage across historical time?” \n“Are long-standing racial inequalities declining, persisting, or increasing in recent years?”\nMany of these questions are methodologically difficult to answer with observational (non-experimental) data, and they require that we get a handle on the study of change, context, and causality. You likely have learned how to answer questions like these with standard OLS (linear) regression techniques and cross-sectional data, which remain useful tools in social scientists’ methodological toolbox. But these techniques are also quite limited, and impose strict assumptions that do not allow us to meet many of our goals, adequately answer our questions, or provide stringent tests of our theories and hypotheses.\nIn this course, we’ll pick up where introductory statistics courses leave off, and get an introduction to more advanced statistical methods for observational data, including but not limited to: regression for categorical dependent variables, fixed and random effects models, and hierarchical linear modeling. This course will be a mix of seminar and lecture, where we will be focused on understanding how we can use these methods to better meet our goals and answer our research questions. Put differently, this course is less focused on going “under the hood” and more focused on “how to drive”—specifically, we will interrogate the assumptions and use of these statistical methods in the social sciences and learn how to implement these methods using STATA. This will include: discussion of core methodological assumptions and limitations, how to apply these statistical methods in different settings, and learning when specific methods are appropriate tools and when they are not. We will explore these issues through student-led discussions, hands-on data analysis, and dissecting the application of these methods in academic journal articles. As part of this course, you will be exposed to (and critique) a wide range of sociological research published in our major disciplinary journals. The course will culminate in an independent research project where students will analyze data and use the one or more of the modeling techniques discussed during the term to answer a sociological research question of their choosing. SOCY 10 or equivalent and a basic understanding of STATA is required to enroll in this course.",

It examines the organization and operation of different kinds of markets, different theories of how economic activity is organized, and the social factors that contribute to economic success or failure.

Since it is at once a type of music, a dance, a distinctive type of poetry and a community (social dance or milonga), the tango requires a variety of disciplines to interpret it. This course will provide students with tools to understand tango as music, poetry, dance, language (lunfardo), and melodrama, from the 19th century to its current state of political resistance and globalized commodification.

Using the image of the slaughterhouse in texts and images spanning 250 years of Southern cone history, we will explore various issues and debates within animal studies, from animal rights and biopolitics to modernization of killing, exploitation of bodies and zones of indetermination between animals and humans.

But that is of course a prejudice from our modern times that need to be debunked in light of social attitudes towards power documented during that time period. We will explore salient cases from political revolution to subtle resistance in early modern texts and images of Spain and Spanish America.

Beyond traditional stereotypes of the 60s as the period of drugs, sex and rock ‘n roll, protesters and political activists were inordinately adept at creating and mobilizing artistic symbols, music, and literature to promote their agenda. We will study the creation of Aztlán as an imaginary Chicano homeland in the Southwest; works of individual Latino artists and writers; important journals (Con Safos, Chismearte, Arte del Varrio); organizations such as the Royal Chicano Air Force, Asco, Galería de la Raza, the Teatro Campesino, the Nuyorican Poets’ Café; national monuments such as Chicano Park; and exhibitions such as Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation (CARA; held at UCLA).

His early work showed the influence of the Enlightenment and had a critical point of view that aimed to not only please but also educate his viewers. As time went by, the ravages of illness, war, and political repression showed in his paintings through impactful and enigmatic imagery that upended the traditional role of an artist and that has earned him a relevant place in contemporary Spanish culture, as shown in his numerous films that bring him alive. Although he became a court painter and was well connected to the monarchy, a closer look to his paintings reveals a critical stance that urges his viewers to reflect on the lack of meaning in modern society. From the royal tapestries and portraits, to the incisive Caprichos, the impactful Disasters of the War and the desperate Black Paintings, we will examine the history of Spain through Goya's major works, not only as subject but also as object of representation in literature and in films.",

Gabriel García Márquez’s novel opens up a magical world where the boundaries that separate fantasy and reality, fairy tale and history seem to dissolve naturally. And yet, no fictional work has ever been more deeply grounded in the reality and history of a people. The book tells the incredible story of the Buendía family as it develops through the successive cycles of destruction and rebirth that shape history in the mythical world of Macondo. As the story unfolds it illuminates the wonders and terrors of the history of Latin American countries, the complexities and contradictions that have defined their peoples, and shaped their cultures. In this course we will read enjoy and analyze One Hundred Years of Solitude as well as a selection of García Márquez’s short stories and journalistic works. The works will be discussed within the framework of major theoretical and historical issues and in constant dialogue with a variety of secondary sources.",

Twentieth and twenty-first century artists have radicalized their works to question the legitimacy of artistic institutions and the capitalist logic of the art market. Film, photography, media, literature, theater, and performance also deploy the decolonizing Boricua Gaze to shed light on Puerto Rico’s colonial condition, while muralism, parades, and public street festivals in the Puerto Rican enclaves of the US serve as visual forms of resistance against gentrification, political corruption, and the violent policing of brown and black bodies. Students in this senior seminar will engage with a broad repertoire of artistic and material practices in order to produce interdisciplinary scholarship that reflects the historical, social, and political dimensions of Puerto Rican visual cultures.",

We explore the larger institutional frameworks that gave meaning to their lives, and within this framework we investigate theri live choices over time.",

In doing so, we will situate the histories and social worlds of the region in a global frame, asking how global political and economic transformations have affected the region. At the same time that we attend closely to these histories, we will also examine the ways in which the category of “woman” has been mobilized in popular and political discourses in the 18th-21th centuries, paying particular attention to how Muslim and Middle Eastern women have been represented in various political discourses, as well as how they have represented themselves. Through close readings of both primary sources (in translation) and secondary literature — including historiographical, theoretical, and literary texts as well as film and music— we will also tackle the questions, controversies, and stereotypes that have animated debates in both scholarly and popular literature on such topics as the veil, feminism, revolution, human rights, LGBT issues, masculinity, and war.",

    "description": "“The past does things.” These words were written by José Esteban Muñoz in his 2009 text Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity. This course offers an opportunity to explore how past histories of domination continue to emanate into the present. Through the lens of feminist and queer of color performance, we will engage a diverse array of aesthetic forms—including performance and installation art, literature, poetry, film, music, and new media— in order to learn how cultural practitioners use the arts to sustain life in a world framed by overlapping legacies of white supremacy, colonialism, capitalism, and heteropatriarchy. Our readings and materials will be interdisciplinary, spanning gender and queer studies, critical ethnic studies, American studies, and performance studies. Traversing 20th and 21st century cultural production, each week will be organized around artists and writers who actively engage the concept of memory as a political act against the denial or disavowal of violence. We set out to understand the social, political, and economic contexts in which artists create their work, addressing issues of race, gender, sexuality, nation, class, ability, and environmental decay. In doing so, we come to more intimately know how performances of time, memory, and trauma include a fervent belief in the potential of queer and feminist possibility. Throughout the term, students will participate in critical, creative, and collaborative assignments that will develop critical thinking, writing, and interdisciplinary engagement.",

    "description": "Transnational feminism, in its broadest vision, has been the project of “feminism without borders.” Rooted in intersectionality, justice, praxis, and solidarity, the banner of transnational feminism has assembled scholars and activists from diverse social and geopolitical positions through coalitions across global, regional, national, and local borders, both within and beyond the nation-state. This course begins with genealogies of global, women of color, and postcolonial or Third World feminisms and histories of movement-building from which transnational feminism emerged. Students will be introduced to themes of universalism, solidarity, positionality, and the problems with  speaking for “others,” especially Northern feminists representing women in the Global South. In the second part of the course, we turn to contemporary topics in transnational feminism, including globalization, development, war, militarism, labor, migration, climate change, and humanitarianism, and feminist mobilizing against injustice within and across borders.",

We examine spectacular and everyday forms of violence in terms of manifestations of power, structures of inequality, perceptions of difference, and politics of representation. Ethnographic studies are drawn from, among others, Mozambique, Haiti, and Harlem. An introduction to the cultural anthropology of violence, this course raises key quesitons about violence in a globalized world and explores how to study it anthropologically.

We will read in the work of eight or nine poets and recent critical and theoretical writings, with some attention in the first weeks to important female and male precursors.

Questions about gender clearly implicate sexuality, class, ethnicity, race, and power, as well, in complex, compelling, and unexpected ways. We will read works by Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Emily Brontë, Charlotte Brontë, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot, and we will end the class by reading substantial excerpts from the private, unpublished diaries of the women writers who published as “Michael Field.”",

To answer these questions, we will engage with primarily contemporary Asian/American works of literature, poetry, film, performance, and art that alters, disrupts, and varies Asian/American narratives of migration, assimilation, and upward mobility.

We will look at new styles in literary journalism pioneered by women, notably Frances Fitzgerald on Vietnam, Joan Didion on cultural issues in 60s and 70s, Oriana Fallaci on world leaders, and Sheryl WuDunn on China. We will analyze the work of women columnists who have changed the face of political discourse in the U.S., and examine the historical contributions of muckrakers like Ida Tarbell and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells Barnett. This course will involve critical reading, original reporting, and several article-length papers. Students will be expected to produce a publishable, magazine-length article at the end of the term.",

Today’s “Datafication” is a process of transforming diverse processes, qualities, actions and phenomena into forms that are machine-readable by digital technologies, but the act of turning humans and human bodies into quanta of information has a long history. We will be using art, new media, history, information science, and more to think through the impact that datafication has on how we understand ourselves and others. Particular attention will be paid to the ways in which data has historically been used in racializing and gendering ways, and the role that quantification of people has been integral to the development of the Western nation-state.",

Moreover, proponents of sexual science in Europe and North America adopted notions forged in exchange with actors in Asia, Latin America and Africa, e.g., the US practice of gender reassignment surgery was heavily influenced by earlier Mexican cases or the German legal understanding of homosexuality was tested and contested in its colonial African courts.  We will study many figures who have been forgotten in contemporary work on sexuality or sexual science.  Some of these figures drew from the repressive legal, social and cultural discourses that limited sexual expression and gave the ideological grounds to discrimination and persecution.  But others—and they were at times the very same figures—connected to the liberating discourses, the power of which we are experiencing today.",

We will read primary texts in the anatomical, astronomical, mathematical, and physical sciences, along with contemporary theory on gender, science, and Anglo-American cultures.

The syllabus moves then to figurations of queerness in popular (and queer) imagination, for instance the 'Drag Queen' or the 'Vampire' with special attention on the AIDS crisis and will finally focus on gender-ambivalence, transgender, and gender-bending performances such Butch-Femme aesthetic or Glam-Rock.
